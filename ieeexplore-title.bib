abstract={Virtualization offers several benefits for optimal resource utilization over traditional non-virtualized server farms. With improvements in internetworking technologies and increase in network bandwidth speeds, a new era of computing has been ushered in, that of grids and clouds. With several commercial cloud providers coming up, each with their own APIs, application description formats, and varying support for SLAs, vendor lockin has become a serious issue for end users. This article attempts to describe the problem, issues, possible solutions and challenges in achieving cloud interoperability. These issues will be analyzed in the ambit of the European project Contrail that is trying to adopt open standards with available virtualization solutions to enhance users' trust in the clouds by attempting to prevent vendor lock-ins, supporting and enforcing SLAs together with adequate data protection for sensitive data.},

abstract={Due to the heterogeneity of today's cloud providers, migrating applications between providers is extremely challenging. This lack of portability is caused, in part, by vendor lock-in: the strong dependency created between a cloud user and a cloud provider since the cloud user deploys their software on a specific cloud platform. This paper outlines our plans to address vendor lock-in by applying techniques from the area of model-driven engineering (MDE), a contemporary and principled approach to software engineering that has sometimes been used to achieve greater portability of software. This paper presents preliminary models of two widely used IaaS services and an analysis of literature reporting real cases of software migration, and introduces a research question and method for our future work on using MDE to address vendor lock-in for cloud computing.},

abstract={Though the current cloud computing is in its initial stage of development, some established players, such as Amazon, Google, Salesforce.com, have captured market shares with their own strategies and standards. However, for a further development for this immature market, it has been proposed a general standard (like TCP/IP for internet) among cloud participants. There are some standards under drafting, but it seems impractical for established players to agree on a general one, for they already have their own standards. What's more, the ongoing creation in the industry undermines standardization, On the other hand, each cloud provider is taking an active role in making its own API, for instance VMware's vCloud, an open standard, but the cost is consumers' lock-in. Thus, conversion technology seems to have a brighter future than standardization towards achieving interoperability. This study discusses various issues concerning the realization of interoperability by conversion technology. Primarily, an economic model is used for reference to analyze the market's incentive to adopt such technology, especially in such a market with network effects. Then a sequence of issues regarding technique, economy, management, security and politics are put forward and discussed, ending with an outlook for the industry. These discussions have important implications for realization of interoperability under the current condition where standardization is somewhat costly and impractical.},

abstract={The HL7 standard was initially designed to enable interoperability of healthcare information within large hospitals. HL7's focus has recently been extended to regional healthcare cloud infrastructures but not yet reached the lightweight fog infrastructures emerging from niche healthcare areas such as body area networks (BANs) and the massive flow of personal medical records resulting from off-the-shelf e-health devices and networks. This paper addresses the issue of interoperability between fog and cloud computing platforms by i) proposing a framework for a standardized exchange of information between healthcare entities ii) designing and implementing a software tool to be integrated into medical data dissemination protocols to ensure interoperability and iii) evaluating the impact of the software tool on the transport of data when exchanging healthcare information using “in-band” and “out-band” transport over the IEEE802.15.4/ZigBee and WiFi protocols. Our results reveal that, for the lightweight devices used by fog infrastructures, “out-band” transport over WiFi with edge data translation into HL7 records is a better option than “in-band” transport.},

abstract={In cloud computing, interoperability typically refers to the ability to easily move workloads and data from one cloud provider to another or between private and public clouds. A common tactic for enabling interoperability is the use of open standards, so there is currently a large amount of active work in standards development for the Cloud. This paper explores the role of standards in cloud-computing interoperability. It covers standard-related efforts, discusses several cloud interoperability use cases, and provides some recommendations for moving forward with cloud-computing adoption regardless of the maturity of standards for the cloud.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a term applied to large, hosted datacenters, usually geographically distributed, which offer various computational services on a ldquoutilityrdquo basis. Most typically the configuration and provisioning of these datacenters, as far as the services for the subscribers go, is highly automated, to the point of the service being delivered within seconds of the subscriber request. Additionally, the datacenters typically use hypervisor based virtualization as a technique to deliver these services. The concept of a cloud operated by one service provider or enterprise interoperating with a clouds operated by another is a powerful idea. So far that is limited to use cases where code running on one cloud explicitly references a service on another cloud. There is no implicit and transparent interoperability. Use cases for interoperability, as well as work-in-progress around inter-cloud protocols and formats for enabling those use cases, are discussed in this paper.},

Current cloud systems have been developed without concerns of seamless cloud interconnection, and actually they do not support intercloud interoperability. The paper proposes a conceptual model for Intercloud Interoperability, to enable schedule dynamic operation for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) between different clouds. The paper is providing a better understanding of elaborates on the cloud computing architecture, appropriate metrics for Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Quality of Service (QoS) models that are required for seamless integration and interoperability between cloud environments. Then, a conceptual model for the Intercloud Interoperability Framework for Workload Migration is proposed. The novel component of the framework that provides interoperability is the Transformation Engine that maps workload between heterogeneous cloud providers, whilst Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is adopted as an applicable method for developing the Transformation Engine module.},

abstract={The combination of hardware assisted virtualization and the broadband Internet have taken the Information Technology (IT) hosted managed services to a next level of evolution, where the software applications have become independent of the hardware infrastructure and can be migrated at will. This introduces two key issues that need to be addressed to fully leverage the potential that the new servers and virtualization offer: 1. The operation and management of virtual services have to be decoupled from the operation and management of the server, network and storage physical infrastructure that hosts them 2. Resource provisioning must be application sensitive, dynamic to meet the transient nature of services that can migrate and must accommodate latency constraints of services that utilize them. The second international IEEE Workshop On collaboration & Cloud Computing under the aegis of 19th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE) 2010, is devoted to address the operation and management issues in the next generation cloud computing. Seven papers discuss various aspects of bringing telecom grade “trust” and global interoperability to distributed collaborating computing clouds.},

abstract={Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for organizations to adopt IT services at a reduced cost with increased reliability and scalability. However organizations are slow in adopting the cloud model due to the prevalent vendor lock-in issue and challenges associated with it. While the existing cloud solutions for public and private companies are vendor locked-in by design, their existence is subject to limited possibility to interoperate with other cloud systems. In this paper we have presented a critical review of pertinent business, technical and legal issues associated with vendor lock-in, and how it impacts on the widespread adoption of cloud computing. The paper attempts to reflect on the issues associated with interoperability and portability, but with a focus on vendor lock-in. Moreover, the paper demonstrates the importance of interoperability, portability and standards applicable to cloud computing environments along with highlighting other corporate concerns due to the lock-in problem. The outcome of this paper provides a foundation for future analysis and review regarding the impact of vendor neutrality for corporate cloud computing application and services.},

abstract={The idea behind cloud computing is to deliver Infrastructure-, Platform- and Software-as-a-Service (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) over the Internet on an easy pay-per-use business model. However, current offerings from cloud providers are based on proprietary technologies. As a consequence, consumers run into a risk of a vendor lock-in with little flexibility in moving their services to other providers. This can hinder the advancement of cloud computing to small- and medium-sized enterprises. To address these issues, standardization efforts have to take place in order to support further developments in the clouds. Standardized exchange mechanisms and interfaces are crucial in order to facilitate interoperability. In this paper, we look at several cloud standards, such as Open Virtualization Format, Open Cloud Computing Interface, and Cloud Data Management Interface, and analyze them against a taxonomy in order to point out their role for interoperability in IaaS. The taxonomy presents important IaaS topics, such as access mechanism, virtual appliance, security, and service-level agreement.},

The success of Internet of Things (IoT) will not so much depend on the development of new technologies, but rather on connecting and integrating existing resources. The paper proposes a novel architecture that enables objects to exchange information through the Internet to achieve nonintrusive behavior and customized services based on an open source cloud platform. To achieve this goal, the information driven interactions are done not only in a peer to peer method, but also via advanced cloud services. The result is a generic platform where devices, systems and services will take part in a heterogeneous and decentralized architecture. We demonstrate that IoT is all about interoperability, from connected cloud computing using RFID, NFC, M2M and sensor technology to digital content and context-aware services. We conclude our cloud of things vision by expanding on the need for interoperability of cloud and IoT.},

abstract={In academia, many institutes have deployed IaaS cloud services in isolation, based on cloud management frameworks of their choice, making the cloudscape quite heterogeneous. Now, with the effort to federate cloud resources well underway, the challenge is not to make everyone switch to a common solution, but rather to allow everyone to keep their setup but still provide uniform access to essential services. This seems to be best achieved by implementing common standards. This paper discusses the different areas such standardization effort must address, ranging from the choice of the actual standardization approach (i.e., Choosing a recognized open standard or possibly a non-standard solution with a strong community backing) through authentication and virtual machine life-cycle management to monitoring or accounting (billing) services. The discussion is based on the authors' own practical experience with implementing standard compliance in multiple cloud management frameworks, producing a real-world interoperability solution -- the rOCCI Framework - which is also introduced in the paper.},
