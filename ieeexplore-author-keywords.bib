abstract={In this paper, cloud computing standards are discussed. The basic idea of cloud computing is simple: centralized service organizations maintain and support IT services, freeing users from nearly all operational and administrative burdens. These service organizations are often subdivided based on whether they provide software-as-a service, platform-as-a-service, and infrastructure as-a-service, but their need for standards appear similar. The biggest need is for evaluative standards that let customers assess the security and reliability of cloud vendors.},

abstract={The majority of the IT world is currently shifting to cloud platforms, and this calls for a greater measure of security for clouds. The emphasis for security originates from the need to transfer data across or within clouds without a third party being able to access the transferred information. This data is encrypted and decrypted using keys and is managed by Key Lifecycle Managers (KLMs) which communicate using a standardized protocol. Thus, to provide end user flexibility which helps in choosing the most reliable KLM, it is essential for cloud platforms to provide support for a standardized protocol so as to allow integration with external Key Lifecycle Managers.},

abstract={Though the current cloud computing is in its initial stage of development, some established players, such as Amazon, Google, Salesforce.com, have captured market shares with their own strategies and standards. However, for a further development for this immature market, it has been proposed a general standard (like TCP/IP for internet) among cloud participants. There are some standards under drafting, but it seems impractical for established players to agree on a general one, for they already have their own standards. What's more, the ongoing creation in the industry undermines standardization, On the other hand, each cloud provider is taking an active role in making its own API, for instance VMware's vCloud, an open standard, but the cost is consumers' lock-in. Thus, conversion technology seems to have a brighter future than standardization towards achieving interoperability. This study discusses various issues concerning the realization of interoperability by conversion technology. Primarily, an economic model is used for reference to analyze the market's incentive to adopt such technology, especially in such a market with network effects. Then a sequence of issues regarding technique, economy, management, security and politics are put forward and discussed, ending with an outlook for the industry. These discussions have important implications for realization of interoperability under the current condition where standardization is somewhat costly and impractical.},

abstract={The importance of healthcare information technology has increased dramatically during the past few years. Researchers, developers, and companies have placed efforts to develop mobile, web, desktop, and enterprise e-health applications. This development raised the importance of interoperability and data exchange between e-health applications and Health Information Systems (HIS), which resulted in increased concerns for securing sensitive data and data exchange. This paper emphasizes standardizing a data exchange mechanism and interoperability between HISs and e-health applications across a cloud-based service. The proposed service provides a single point of entry for retrieving Electronic Medical Records (EMR) among the various HISs that a patient record is stored in and for any e-health application seeking such information. Moreover, this research proposes a unified secure platform that provides developers, health care providers, and organizations access to a framework to retrieve and manage medical records and Personal Health Records (PHR) among various subscribers. The proposed service and platform have been qualitatively evaluated among a sample of physicians, patients, and hospital administrators from the Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Egypt. Results are promising and a prototype implementation is underway.},

abstract={The incessant trend where software engineers need to redesign legacy systems adopting a service-centric engineering approach brings new challenges for software architects and developers. Today, engineering and deploying software as a service requires specific Internet protocols, middleware and languages that often complicate the interoperability of software at all levels. Moreover, cloud computing demands stringent quality requirements, such as security, scalability, and interoperability among others, to provide services and data across networks more efficiently. As software engineers must face the problem to redesign and redeploy systems as services, we explore in this paper the challenges found during the migration of an existing system to a cloud solution and based on a set of quality requirements that includes the vendor Lock-in factor. We also present a set of assessment activities and guidelines to support migration to the Cloud by adopting SOA and Cloud modeling standards and tools.},

abstract={Cloud computing model has been among the main stream popular new technologies by providing services such as software, platform and infrastructure. In the process of providing better services for customers, cloud service providers have developed proprietary standards on how cloud application interacts with their cloud. This has been limiting the cloud adoption because of the vendor lock-in and portability issues. The need for the business application on clouds to be interoperable is increasing. The cloud federation would be the solution in providing on demand resources and better scalability. The IEEE cloud computing working standard groups have certain standards to build interoperable cloud environment. The paper explores the approach for cloud federation by using standard protocols by implementing IEEE standards as a proof of concept using multiple OpenStack environment, which can be easily extended to other clouds (AWS, Azure, VMware) and finally conclude with benefits of using standards based federation.},

abstract={Efficient mechanisms for data structuring and formatting are indispensable for managing data traffic between and within federated Cloud environments to avoid excessive bandwidth cost and to ensure portability and interoperability. This facilitates provider-agnostic communication, which is essential for interoperable inter-Cloud deployments and portable integration of service components, both with one another and with the underlying Cloud platform. The existing data interchange formats for structuring and serialising data have not yet been analysed in the context of data communication in Clouds. Thus, to address this issue, the determination of an appropriate data interchange format for Clouds is necessary. In this paper, we present a performance analysis of some selected data interchange formats to assess their efficiency in terms of their usability in realising a common messaging format for communicating data in Clouds. We first describe the characteristics of each data format for clear understanding. As a basis for the analysis, we introduce a Cloud use case scenario comprising the transmission of monitored data as messages. The communication means is achieved with a novel message bus system designed to integrate the data interchange formats. We present some evaluations of the formats and compare their compactness for supporting efficient data transmission in Clouds.},

This collaboration lets companies to choose and to move their applications and data among clouds without being tied to any provider. We have embedded the Service Component Architecture in the cloud computing domain. The proposed model aims at facilitating the data sharing between multiple cloud service providers regardless their infrastructure, tools and platforms. Indeed, we have opted for SCA standard to promote the interoperability mechanism by moving and converting data formats exchanged among clouds.

abstract={The unabated flurry of research activities to augment various mobile devices by leveraging heterogeneous cloud resources has created a new research domain called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). In the core of such a non-uniform environment, facilitating interoperability, portability, and integration among heterogeneous platforms is nontrivial. Building such facilitators in MCC requires investigations to understand heterogeneity and its challenges over the roots. Although there are many research studies in mobile computing and cloud computing, convergence of these two areas grants further academic efforts towards flourishing MCC. In this paper, we define MCC, explain its major challenges, discuss heterogeneity in convergent computing (i.e. mobile computing and cloud computing) and networking (wired and wireless networks), and divide it into two dimensions, namely vertical and horizontal. Heterogeneity roots are analyzed and taxonomized as hardware, platform, feature, API, and network. Multidimensional heterogeneity in MCC results in application and code fragmentation problems that impede development of cross-platform mobile applications which is mathematically described. The impacts of heterogeneity in MCC are investigated, related opportunities and challenges are identified, and predominant heterogeneity handling approaches like virtualization, middleware, and service oriented architecture (SOA) are discussed. We outline open issues that help in identifying new research directions in MCC.},

abstract={IDIPOS, that stands for Italian Database Infrastructure for Polar Observation Sciences, has been conceived to realize a feasibility study on infrastructure devoted to management of data coming from Polar areas. This framework adopted a modular approach identifying two main parts: the first one defines main components of infrastructure, and, the latter selects possible cloud solutions to manage and organize these components. The main purpose is the creation of a scalable and flexible infrastructure for the exchange of scientific data from various application fields. The envisaged infrastructure is based on the cutting-edge technology of the Community Cloud Infrastructure for an aggregation and federation of resources, to optimize the use of hardware. The infrastructure is composed of: a central node, several nodes distributed in Italy, interconnection between other systems realized in Polar areas. This paper aims to investigate cloud solution, and explore the key factors which may influence cloud adoption in the project such as scalability, flexibility and expandability. In particular, main cloud aspects addressed are related to data storage, data management, data analysis, infrastructure federation following recommendations from the Cloud Expert Group to allow sharing information in scientific communities.},

pages={452-459}, 
abstract={Cost and scalability benefits of Cloud storage services are apparent. However, selecting a single storage service provider limits availability and scalability to the selected provider and may further cause a vendor lock-in effect. In this paper, we present MetaStorage, a federated Cloud storage system that can integrate diverse Cloud storage providers. MetaStorage is a highly available and scalable distributed hash table that replicates data on top of diverse storage services. MetaStorage reuses mechanisms from Amazon's Dynamo for cross-provider replication and hence introduces a novel approach to manage consistency-latency tradeoffs by extending the traditional quorum (N,R,W) configurations to an (N_P,R,W) scheme that includes different providers as an additional dimension. With MetaStorage, new means to control consistency-latency tradeoffs are introduced.},

abstract={Cloud computing enables the on-demand delivery of resources for a multitude of services and gives the opportunity for small agile companies to compete with large industries. In the telco world, cloud computing is currently mostly used by mobile network operators (MNO) for hosting non-critical support services and selling cloud services such as applications and data storage. MNOs are investigating the use of cloud computing to deliver key telecommunication services in the access and core networks. Without this, MNOs lose the opportunities of both combining this with over-the-top (OTT) and value-added services to their fundamental service offerings and leveraging cost-effective commodity hardware. Being able to leverage cloud computing technology effectively for the telco world is the focus of mobile cloud networking (MCN). This paper presents the key results of MCN integrated project that includes its architecture advancements, prototype implementation, and evaluation. Results show the efficiency and the simplicity that a MNO can deploy and manage the complete service lifecycle of fully cloudified, composed services that combine OTT/IT- and mobile-network-based services running on commodity hardware. The extensive performance evaluation of MCN using two key proof-of-concept scenarios that compose together many services to deliver novel converged elastic, on-demand mobile-based but innovative OTT services proves the feasibility of such fully virtualized deployments. Results show that it is beneficial to extend cloud computing to telco usage and run fully cloudified mobile-network-based systems with clear advantages and new service opportunities for MNOs and end-users.},

abstract={Parallel scientific workloads typically entail highly-customised software environments, involving complex data structures, specialised systems software, and even distinct hardware, where virtualisation is not necessarily supported by third-party providers. Considering the expansion of cloud computing in different domains and the development of different proprietary (e.g. Amazon Web Services, Azure) and open source cloud platforms (Eucalyptus, OpenStack, OpenNebula), users should arguably be able to automatically and seamlessly migrate their parallel workloads across cloud platforms using standardised virtual machines. However, even if it is easier to migrate the workload between nodes when the nodes have a similar configuration on the same platform, the transition between different platforms typically raises different issues such as vendor lock-in, portability, and interoperability. In this paper, we describe our work to automatically deploy a complex parallel software stack on heterogeneous hybrid cloud platforms. We have elastically deployed FastFlow - a C/C++ pattern-based programming framework for multi-/many-core and distributed platforms -- using virtual machines on both CPU and GPU-based architectures between heterogeneous virtualised platforms. Our approach relies on the standard Open Virtualization Format (OVF) in order to achieve a universal description of virtual appliances. Such a description is not only useful for elastically migrating and deploying, but also to determine the hardware/system software configuration needed switching to any new (cloud) image format. We have successfully evaluated our work using virtual machines based on VirtualBox and Amazon Web Services on local cluster and public cloud providers.},

Current cloud systems have been developed without concerns of seamless cloud interconnection, and actually they do not support intercloud interoperability. The paper proposes a conceptual model for Intercloud Interoperability, to enable schedule dynamic operation for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) between different clouds. The paper is providing a better understanding of elaborates on the cloud computing architecture, appropriate metrics for Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Quality of Service (QoS) models that are required for seamless integration and interoperability between cloud environments. Then, a conceptual model for the Intercloud Interoperability Framework for Workload Migration is proposed. The novel component of the framework that provides interoperability is the Transformation Engine that maps workload between heterogeneous cloud providers, whilst Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is adopted as an applicable method for developing the Transformation Engine module.},

abstract={Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for organizations to adopt IT services at a reduced cost with increased reliability and scalability. However organizations are slow in adopting the cloud model due to the prevalent vendor lock-in issue and challenges associated with it. While the existing cloud solutions for public and private companies are vendor locked-in by design, their existence is subject to limited possibility to interoperate with other cloud systems. In this paper we have presented a critical review of pertinent business, technical and legal issues associated with vendor lock-in, and how it impacts on the widespread adoption of cloud computing. The paper attempts to reflect on the issues associated with interoperability and portability, but with a focus on vendor lock-in. Moreover, the paper demonstrates the importance of interoperability, portability and standards applicable to cloud computing environments along with highlighting other corporate concerns due to the lock-in problem. The outcome of this paper provides a foundation for future analysis and review regarding the impact of vendor neutrality for corporate cloud computing application and services.},

Exploiting the Semantic Web technologies, the framework has the objective of allowing semantic interoperability among distributed software agents preserving not only semantics of transmitted messages, but also the subjectivity of agent's world vision in the communication process. The proposed system, in fact, will help users in the digital documents exchanging activities by extracting the related relevant information and coding their informative contents in a shape capable of preserving the original semantics, also in the case of communications agents using different or incompatible vocabularies. The framework is a an evolution of semantic interoperable methodologies towards cloud computer technologies, thus guaranteeing several advantages in terms of usability, scalability and fault tolerance. In particular, we implemented a prototype that provides interoperability functionalities in the E-Health domain, managing information coming from heterogeneous sources.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the emerging problem of semantic interoperability between heterogeneous cooperating Cloud platforms. We try to pave the way towards a Reference Architecture for Semantically Interoperable Clouds (RASIC). To this end, three fundamental and complementary computing paradigms, namely Cloud computing, Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and lightweight semantics are used as the main building blocks. The open, generic Reference Architecture for Semantically Interoperable Clouds introduces a scalable, reusable and transferable approach for facilitating the design, deployment and execution of resource intensive SOA services on top of semantically interlinked Clouds. In order to support the development of semantically interoperable Cloud systems based on RASIC, the model of a common Cloud API is also specified.},

abstract={Originated from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have been applied to numerous domains. However, after an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art, several factors have been found to limit the development of applications based on BSNs. In this paper we introduce the concept of Open BSNs for improving the development of BSNs. Specifically, open BSNs can improve key aspects such as energy efficiency, system interoperability, system usability and scalability, and privacy support. Application scenarios and future research challenges of Open BSNs are also presented.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is a new computing paradigm where a large amount of computing capacity is offered on demand and only paying for what you use. Several Infrastructure Providers have adopted this approach offering resources which are easily managed by means of web-based APIs. However, if a user wants to use different providers, the resource management becomes tedious because providers define different API requiring a special implementation for interacting with each of them. In this paper, we present a methodology for making the provider interoperability easier. In this methodology, each provider's API is modeled by an ontology. Equivalences between these ontologies are modeled by rules, and messages used in a provider's API are converted in calls to another provider's API applying these rules. With our approach, users interact with Infrastructure Providers using their most familiar API and the translation to the other APIs is automatically done by the system.},

Integrated electronic health records (EHRs) and Personal Health Records (PHRs) play a crucial role in providing continuous health care. Although, IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) has developed the XDS (Cross Enterprise Document Sharing) integration profile for sharing clinical documents among computer systems in healthcare, the XDS integration profile may not directly support cloud computing environments where repository systems are heterogeneous and virtualized. In this paper, we propose a PHR cloud system architecture based on the cloud computing Service Model defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and adopt the IHE XDS integration profile for system interoperability. To enhance computation power and system scalability we include Hadoop parallel computing model and implement a NoSQL storage layer in this PHR cloud architecture. Our approach presented here to PHR Systems Cloud architecture could be a paradigm for sharing documents in health care settings and supporting cloud computing as well.},

abstract={With the popularity of cloud computing and SaaS, enterprises are willing to rent various cloud services and use them in their daily work. However, on-premise applications are still widely used inside enterprises. That is to say, to achieve the goal of business collaboration, a cloud service usually need to obtain business data from multiple sources, which include the relevant on-premise applications and other cloud services. In this paper, we study and summarize data organization and management patterns for cloud enterprise applications from different aspects. Based on these patterns, we propose an innovative cloud-based data organization model (CEDM). Compared with traditional ones, it highlights the characters of resource sharing and reuse. Besides, this model is more convenient for tackling complex data synchronization issues in cloud environment.},

pages={37-46}, 
abstract={Porting applications from one cloud platform to another is difficult, making vendor lock-in a major impediment to cloud adoption. Model-driven engineering could be used to determine how applications might run on different platforms, if platform schemas could be matched. However, schema matching typically relies on linguistic and structural similarities, and cloud schema terms diverge so much that such matching is impossible. To address this challenge, we introduce Prison Break: a novel, semi-automated and generic schema matching process. Prison Break solves the divergent vocabulary problem by using web search results as a similarity metric, thus incorporating domain knowledge without constructing a dictionary, lexicon or thesaurus. We tested Prison Break by matching schemas from two major cloud providers: Windows Azure and Google Application Engine. We determined that Prison Break helps solve the vendor lock-in problem by reducing the manual efforts required to map complex correspondences between cloud schemas. This brings us one step closer to automatic model migration across cloud platforms.},

abstract={From its early stages, cloud computing has evolved from being a principal source for computing resources to a fully fledged alternative for rapid application deployment. Especially the service model Platform as a Service facilitates the hosting of scalable applications in the cloud by providing managed and highly automated application environments. Although most offerings are conceptually comparable to each other, the interfaces for application deployment and management vary greatly between vendors. Despite providing similar functionalities, technically different workflows and commands provoke vendor lock-in and hinder portability as well as interoperability. To that end, we present a unified interface for application deployment and management among cloud platforms. We validate our proposal with a reference implementation targeting four leading cloud platforms.

abstract={The idea behind cloud computing is to deliver Infrastructure-, Platform- and Software-as-a-Service (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) over the Internet on an easy pay-per-use business model. However, current offerings from cloud providers are based on proprietary technologies. As a consequence, consumers run into a risk of a vendor lock-in with little flexibility in moving their services to other providers. This can hinder the advancement of cloud computing to small- and medium-sized enterprises. To address these issues, standardization efforts have to take place in order to support further developments in the clouds. Standardized exchange mechanisms and interfaces are crucial in order to facilitate interoperability. In this paper, we look at several cloud standards, such as Open Virtualization Format, Open Cloud Computing Interface, and Cloud Data Management Interface, and analyze them against a taxonomy in order to point out their role for interoperability in IaaS. The taxonomy presents important IaaS topics, such as access mechanism, virtual appliance, security, and service-level agreement.},

This paper introduces an approach to sensor data analytics by using the OpenIoT1 middleware; real time event processing and clustering algorithms have been used for this purpose. The OpenIoT platform has been extended to support stream processing and thus we demonstrate its flexibility in enabling real time on-demand application domain analytics. We use mobile crowd-sensed data, provided in real time from wearable sensors, to analyse and infer air quality conditions. This experimental evaluation has been implemented using the design principles and methods for IoT data interoperability specified by the OpenIoT project. We describe an event and clustering analytics server that acts as an interface for novel analytical IoT services. The approach presented in this paper also demonstrates how sensor data acquired from mobile devices can be integrated within IoT platforms to enable analytics on data streams.

abstract={During the past years the Cloud Computing offer has exponentially grown, with new Cloud providers, platforms and services being introduced in the IT market. The extreme variety of services, often providing non uniform and incompatible interfaces, makes it hard for customers to decide how to develop, or even worse to migrate, their own application into the Cloud. This situation can only get worse when customers want to exploit services from different providers, because of the portability and interoperability issues that often arise. In this paper we propose a uniform, integrated, machine-readable, semantic representation of cloud services, patterns, appliances and their compositions. Our approach aims at supporting the development of new applications for the Cloud environment, using semantic models and automatic reasoning to enhance potability and interoperability when multiple platforms are involved. In particular, the proposed reasoning procedure allows to: perform automatic discovery of Cloud services and Appliances; map between agnostic and vendor dependent Cloud Patterns and Services; automatically enrich the semantic knowledge base.},

abstract={Cloud computing is the ``new hot'' topic in IT. It combines the maturity of Web technologies (networking, APIs, semantic Web 2.0, languages, protocols and standards such as WSDL, SOAP, REST, WS-BPEL, WS-CDL, IPSEC, etc.), the robustness of geographically distributed computing paradigm (emph{Network, Internet} and emph{Grid computing}) and self-management capabilities (emph{Autonomic computing}), with the capacity to manage quality of services by monitoring, metering, quantifying and billing computing resources and costs (emph{Utility computing}). Those have made possible and cost-effective for businesses, small and large, to completely host data- and application-centers virtually... in the Cloud. Our idea of Cloud proposes a new dimension of computing, in which everyone, from single users to communities and enterprises, can, on one hand, share resources and services in a transparent way and, on the other hand, have access to and use such resources and services adaptively to their requirements. Such an enhanced concept of Cloud, enriching the original one with Volunteer computing and interoperability challenges, has been proposed and synthesized in Cloud@Home. The complex infrastructure implementing Cloud@Home has to be supported by an adequate distributed middleware able to manage it.},

abstract={Testing as a Service (TaaS) is a new business and service model that provides efficient and effective software quality assurance and enables the use of a cloud for the meeting of quality standards, requirements and consumer's needs. However, problems that limit the effective use of TaaS involve lack of standardization in writing, execution, configuration and management of tests and lack of portability and interoperability among TaaS platforms - the so-called lock-in problem. The lock-in problem is a serious threat to software testing in the cloud and may become critical when a provider decides to suddenly increase prices, or shows serious technical availability problems. This paper proposes a novel approach for solving the lock-in problem in TaaS with the use of design patterns. The aim to assist software engineers and quality control managers in building testing solutions that are both portable and interoperable and promote a more widespread adoption of the TaaS model in cloud computing.},

abstract={Scientists are dealing with a larger and more complex IT infrastructure in their daily work. With the advent of Grid and Cloud technologies this trend continues. Scientists will not only deal with local managed resources, but with resources provided by an arbitrary Cloud service provider. In order to support the scientist in his daily work a scientific workbench is required to interact with IT resources and to perform scientific analysis on them. The g-Eclipse framework is such a platform for Grid/Cloud computing based on the Eclipse ecosystem. Based on the g-Eclipse/Eclipse architecture new scientific applications/tools can be integrated in this workbench. The g-Eclipse workbench is an ideal starting point for building such a workbench for astro particle physics. The usage of remote Cloud resources requires the development of an interoperable communication and software provisioning system too. Using OSGi as a interoperable, provider-independent platform for Cloud computing, the management of the Cloud resources will be simplified significantly. The delivery of software on the scientists computer and on his Cloud resources with a ScienceStore/ScienStore component will be as easy as the deployment of little applications on end customers smart phones.},

abstract={Cloud computing (the delivery of computing as services rather than products) creates new challenges with respect to openness. Existing approaches such as open source licensing of software products have proven inadequate in a service-oriented world; attempts to address the limitations by closing the “service provider loophole” have failed to gain traction. Similarly, multiple providers are yet to fully adopt a single, complete cloud infrastructure management interface. In this paper a simple “lowest common denominator” approach to cloud portability is proposed, modeled after the success of Internet email and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and based on the ubiquitous HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The proposed approach is suitable for all workloads and supports any format specified elsewhere and identified by Internet media (MIME) type (e.g. virtual machines, databases, queues). By addressing only the functionality absolutely required for portability, leaving the management interface out of scope, we can deliver an API which is compatible with all cloud stacks while avoiding constraining their functionality.},

abstract={Cloud definition says "everything is available everywhere at any time". As cloud computing evolves to accommodate future technologies, inter-cloud ecosystem is started to be required as a necessary architecture. Although there are some proposals presented to manage the inter-cloud but no one guarantee a lock-free, interoperable and federated ecosystem. Conducted research is biased and cloud provider's need base, pushing cloud market towards the interests of commercial dominators. To fill this gap, after surveying the maturity of open technologies and current state of adoption of the openness from cloud providers, this paper presents ICCM: Inter-Cloud Concern Model, a reference architecture to model the concerns of interoperable cloud ecosystem. The aim of this research is to formally describe the aspects to be considered to design a people-centric IT solution that put computing providers in a hard competition to fulfill client needs.},

abstract={Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a novel paradigm that enables software developers to create (develop or integrate), deploy, execute, and manage business applications, using a service provided by a third party. The diversity and heterogeneity of the existing PaaS offerings raises several interoperability challenges. The actual Platform as a Service market is still quite young, chaotic and highly fragmented, dominated by a few providers which use and promote incompatible standards and formats. This introduces adoption barriers due to the lock-in issues that prevent the portability of data and software from one PaaS to another. Moreover, software developers do not only need to deploy applications into a specific Cloud platform, but also to migrate applications from one Cloud platform to another, and to manage distributed applications spanning multiple PaaS. In this paper, we present a multi-cloud PaaS management as a result of the Cloud4SOA European project that addresses these challenges.},

abstract={Cloud computing is becoming increasingly popular. Information technology market leaders, e.g., Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, are extensively shifting toward cloud-based solutions. However, there is isolation in the cloud implementations provided by the cloud vendors. Limited interoperability can cause one user to adhere to a single cloud provider; thus, a required migration of an application or data from one cloud provider to another may necessitate a significant effort and/or full-cycle redevelopment to fit the new provider's standards and implementation. The ability to move from one cloud vendor to another would be a step toward advancing cloud computing interoperability and increasing customer trust. This study proposes a cloud broker solution to fill the interoperability gap between different software-as-a-service providers. The proposed cloud broker was implemented and tested on a real enterprise application dataset. The migration process was completed and it worked correctly, according to a specified mapping model.},

abstract={In academia, many institutes have deployed IaaS cloud services in isolation, based on cloud management frameworks of their choice, making the cloudscape quite heterogeneous. Now, with the effort to federate cloud resources well underway, the challenge is not to make everyone switch to a common solution, but rather to allow everyone to keep their setup but still provide uniform access to essential services. This seems to be best achieved by implementing common standards. This paper discusses the different areas such standardization effort must address, ranging from the choice of the actual standardization approach (i.e., Choosing a recognized open standard or possibly a non-standard solution with a strong community backing) through authentication and virtual machine life-cycle management to monitoring or accounting (billing) services. The discussion is based on the authors' own practical experience with implementing standard compliance in multiple cloud management frameworks, producing a real-world interoperability solution -- the rOCCI Framework - which is also introduced in the paper.},

abstract={The pervasiveness of connected embedded devices and Internet of Things (IoT) related application domains like smart cities, e-Health or, transportation lead to an constantly increasing amount of data, compute- and storage resources surrounding us. However, currently there is a gap between data acquisition and processing, usually bridged by gateway based approaches that integrate the devices and forward the data to Clouds in order to be processed. Integration is often static and limited to a certain application domain, which the gateway is able to support. In addition, processing does not consider the compute- and storage resources already made available by the growing amount of smart devices, like smart TVs or smart phones. As a solution, we propose the Device Cloud, which can be envisioned as an application of the Cloud Computing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) paradigms to the IoT domain. The approach will allow sharing and on demand provisioning of resources provided by the connected embedded devices surrounding us. Besides introducing an architecture draft to provide a common understanding of the overall problem, the main focus of the paper is to discuss challenges that arise and give a state of the art review of related research initiatives that are eligible to contribute to possible solutions.},

abstract={Starting with the provision of ready-to-use infrastructures, such as storage and compute resources, cloud computing quickly became a flexible, cost-effective and complete environment for a wide range of IT services offered over the Internet. A growing number of cloud providers started to expose their own services to the market, to answer consumer's need, engaging a competition in the attempt to offer the easiest access to resources and the wider catalogue of services. Being integrated with proprietary services and infrastructures, these offerings makes difficult to switch between different underlying technologies, so that the customer is tied to the service provider's strategy. This lack in standards interfaces, service requirements and technologies brings into the cloud the vendor lock-in problem. Due to this complex scenery, a categorization of services to support the choice of the right solution, as well as a semantic and computable description of services that enables the comparison and the mapping between different providers' services, proves to be extremely appealing. In an attempt to take a first important step in this context we propose the semantic description of some cloud services, exposing them in terms of functionalities, parameters exchanged, and collaboration between services. In particular in this paper we present the semantic representation of Microsoft Windows Azure APIs, describing functional and non-functional properties of the services.},
