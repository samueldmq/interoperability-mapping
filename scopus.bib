abstract={Cloud computing represents an evolution paradigm that enables information technology (IT) capabilities to be delivered “as a service”. In the last decade number of cloud-based services has grown intensely and rapidly. The diversification of cloud service providers has generated the diversification of their offers. Therefore, end-users face a huge challenge while choosing the appropriate cloud provider. Furthermore, the battle for dominance between the big vendors, like Amazon, Google and Salesforce, makes them reluctant to agree on widely accepted standards promoting their own incompatible formats, thus increases the lock-in effect and affects the competition. Interoperability is the missing element that will recover this situation and allows switch between cloud providers whenever needed without setting data and applications at risk. In this paper, we present an approach that will help strengthen semantic and technical interoperability of services. The approach presents a Cloud Community that acts as a broker to mediate between service providers and service consumers based on web ontology language OWLS. This concept would enable end users to select the right services and compose services across multiple Clouds. It would, also, to provide cloud arbitration services that allow users to shift and to choose between existing platforms. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={The significant advancement in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) have enabled the generation of several gigabytes of raw data in a single sequencing run. This amount of raw data introduces new scalability challenges in processing, storing and analyzing it, which cannot be solved using a single workstation, the only resource available for the majority of biological scientists, in a reasonable amount of time. These scalability challenges can be complemented by provisioning computational and storage resources using Cloud Computing in a cost-effective manner. There are multiple cloud providers offering cloud resources as a utility within various business models, service levels and functionalities. However, the lack of standards in cloud computing leads to interoperability issues among the providers rendering the selected one unalterable. Furthermore, even a single provider offers multiple configurations to choose from. Therefore, it is essential to develop a decision making system that facilitates the selection of the suitable cloud provider and configuration together with the capability to switch among multiple providers in an efficient and transparent manner. In this paper, we propose BIOCLOUD as a single point of entry to a multi-cloud environment for non-computer savvy bio-researchers. We discuss the architecture and components of BIOCLOUD and present the scheduling algorithm employed in BIOCLOUD. Experiments with different use-cases and scenarios reveal that BIOCLOUD can decrease the workflow execution time for a given budget while encapsulating the complexity of resource management in multiple cloud providers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Within a closed ecosystem, end-users cannot interoperate with other platforms or port their software and data easily without a cost for interface integration or data re-formatting. The customers of these closed software service platforms are locked-in. Potential customers, who are aware of this lock-in issue, are hesitant to adopt a closed software service platform, slowing down the wide deployment of the software service platform. This paper applies an economic perspective to investigate the value creation for providers and users at different levels of interoperability. For the analysis, a value creation model for software service platforms within a software service ecosystem has been developed. Simulations of the value creation model show that, even if investments in interoperability and portability are aimed at addressing user requirements, their impact also drives the providers’ profitability. Furthermore, emerging providers require investing more than market leading providers, as they have less power to set de facto standards. The simulation results also show that there is an optimal level of investments, with respect to profit and return on investments. Overall, from these results, platform providers cannot only obtain an understanding on how investments in interoperability and portability impact cost, enable cost-effective service integration, and create value, but also design new strategies for optimizing investments. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={The energy consumption of cloud computing continues to be an area of significant concern as data center growth continues to increase. This paper reports on an energy efficient interoperable cloud architecture realised as a cloud toolbox that focuses on reducing the energy consumption of cloud applications holistically across all deployment models. The architecture supports energy efficiency at service construction, deployment and operation. We discuss our practical experience during implementation of an architectural component, the Virtual Machine Image Constructor (VMIC), required to facilitate construction of energy aware cloud applications. We carry out a performance evaluation of the component on a cloud testbed. The results show the performance of Virtual Machine construction, primarily limited by available I/O, to be adequate for agile, energy aware software development. We conclude that the implementation of the VMIC is feasible, incurs minimal performance overhead comparatively to the time taken by other aspects of the cloud application construction life-cycle, and make recommendations on enhancing its performance. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Cloud computing has been the enabling technology for shifting mass scale computation and storage requirements from individually owned clients towards an on-demand and utility styled alternative that provides many services. However, cost of maintaining datacenters, keeping the environmental ramifications of data centers at check, providing affordable computation alternative to users still needs to be addressed in a wholesome manner. One of the most exciting and recent research areas in cloud computing has been cloud federations that can mitigate the aforesaid problems. The past decade has seen immense efforts towards interoperability of clouds leading to realistic cloud federations. Motivated by these advancements and equipped with available technologies, this paper presents a detailed account of a cooperative cloud market. It delineates trading mechanisms of such cloud markets, extent of coordination among market players with illustrative examples. It also presents a novel two-phase coordinated resource reservation and provisioning (CRRP) approach that allocates cloud resources to users to meet the goal of minimizing users’ cost. To that end, this paper proposes a novel Most Cost Effective Providers’ Resources First (MCEPRF) algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been tested using synthetic data and the simulation results presented herein demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over its non-coordinated counterparts. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={The broad diffusion of Cloud Computing has fostered the proliferation of a large number of cloud computing providers. The need of Cloud Brokers arises for helping consumers in discovering, considering and comparing services with different capabilities and offered by different providers. Moreover, consuming services exposed by different providers may alleviate the vendor lock-in issue. While it can be straightforward to choose the best provider when deploying small and homogeneous applications, things get more challenging with large and complex applications. In this paper we propose QBROKAGE, a genetic approach for Cloud Brokering, aiming at finding Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) resources for satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of cloud applications. Our approach is capable of evaluating such requirements both for the single application service and for the application as whole. We performed a set of experiments with an implementation of such broker, by considering three-tier applications and scientific application workflows. Results show that our broker can find near-optimal solutions even when dealing with hundreds of providers, providing optimized deployment solutions that includes data transferring cost across multiple clouds. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years, cloud computing paradigm has attracted a lot of attention from both industry and academia. However, each cloud provider uses its own techniques (languages, standards, ontologies, or models, etc.) to describe cloud services. The diversity of these techniques leads to the vendor lock-in problem, and thus, the lack of a cloud service description standardization. In addition, existing service descriptions cover only particular aspects and neglect others. For example, WSDL covers only technical aspect and does not cover business and semantic ones. Our objective is to define a standardized cloud service description that covers technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. In this paper, we introduce different approaches that have dealt with cloud service description, and thus, we adopt USDL language as an appropriate technique to describe cloud services thanks to its expressivity by covering three perspectives (technical, operational, and business). But, USDL is still limited because it cannot cover semantic aspect and it is not intended for cloud computing domain. After that, we highlight USDL limitations that can appear in cloud computing domain and that should be taken into consideration in our research work. This paper will focus on establishing a WSMO-based ontology to define semantically cloud services. This new cloud service description is based on USDL and we will enhance it by taking into consideration some USDL limitations. Finally, we test our proposed cloud service description model on a case study to prove its applicability. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The cloud computing industry is a swiftly growing sector, with many providers hailing it as a “digital revolution” that will render traditional IT business models obsolete within ten years. Although still under development, the range of circumstances to engage in monopolistic and anti-competitive behaviour in the cloud services market are numerous. Suppliers can engage in tying, exclusive dealing, and refusing to share vital information to allow the creation of technically compatible products. Monopolistic behaviour and pricing strategies can also restrict innovation and result in a lessening of competition. This paper reviews the European laws that have a direct effect on competition in the cloud computing industry. In addition to competition law, other areas of law have an impact on competition in cloud services. Merger regulations for example have a direct effect by controlling market concentrations in the cloud and technology industry. Interoperability has emerged as a key policy and legal consideration in cases concerning competition and merger laws. The concept of interoperability has arisen in cloud computing cases, as well as other areas of law that indirectly impact upon openness and competition. These areas include intellectual property and standardisation. As new areas of interest arise that raise enforcement challenges for regulators, the author maintains that current laws are adequate to meet the competition concerns in the diverse cloud services market. © 2017 Sylvia Song},

abstract={Fatal accidents associated with underground coal mines require the implementation of high-level gas monitoring and miner's localization approaches to promote underground safety and health. This study introduces a real-time monitoring, event-reporting and early-warning platform, based on cluster analysis for outlier detection, spatiotemporal statistical analysis, and an RSS range-based weighted centroid localization algorithm for improving safety management and preventing accidents in underground coal mines. The proposed platform seamlessly integrates monitoring, analyzing, and localization approaches using the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, a real-time operational database, application gateways, and application program interfaces. The prototype has been validated and verified at the operating underground Hassan Kishore coal mine. Sensors for air quality parameters including temperature, humidity, CH4, CO2, and CO demonstrated an excellent performance, with regression constants always greater than 0.97 for each parameter when compared to their commercial equivalent. This framework enables real-time monitoring, identification of abnormal events (&gt;90%), and verification of a miner's localization (with &lt;1.8 m of error) in the harsh environment of underground mines. The main contribution of this study is the development of an open source, customizable, and cost-effective platform for effectively promoting underground coal mine safety. This system is helpful for solving the problems of accessibility, serviceability, interoperability, and flexibility associated with safety in coal mines. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity and rapid development of the cloud storage technology, more and more users are beginning to upload their data to the cloud storage platform. However, solely depending on a particular cloud storage provider has a number of potentially serious problems, such as vendor lock-in, availability and security. To address these problems, we propose a Deduplication-Assisted primary storage system in Cloud-of-Clouds (short for DAC) in this paper. DAC eliminates the redundant data blocks in the cloud computing environment and distributes the data among multiple independent cloud storage providers by exploiting the data reference characteristics. In DAC, the data blocks are stored in multiple cloud storage providers by combing the replication and erasure code schemes. To better utilize the advantages of both replication and erasure code schemes and exploit the reference characteristics in data deduplication, the high referenced data blocks are stored with the replication scheme while the other data blocks are stored with the erasure code scheme. The experiments conducted on our lightweight prototype implementation show that DAC improves the performance and cost efficiency significantly, compared with the existing schemes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The HL7 standard was initially designed to enable interoperability of healthcare information within large hospitals. HL7's focus has recently been extended to regional healthcare cloud infrastructures but not yet reached the lightweight fog infrastructures emerging from niche healthcare areas such as body area networks (BANs) and the massive flow of personal medical records resulting from off-the-shelf e-health devices and networks. This paper addresses the issue of interoperability between fog and cloud computing platforms by i) proposing a framework for a standardized exchange of information between healthcare entities ii) designing and implementing a software tool to be integrated into medical data dissemination protocols to ensure interoperability and iii) evaluating the impact of the software tool on the transport of data when exchanging healthcare information using 'in-band' and 'out-band' transport over the IEEE802.15.4/ZigBee and WiFi protocols. Our results reveal that, for the lightweight devices used by fog infrastructures, 'out-band' transport over WiFi with edge data translation into HL7 records is a better option than 'in-band' transport. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is becoming hot cake of current software industry. Cloud Computing found its root in SOA. Service Oriented Architecture is a computing paradigm, which revolves around the concepts like service registration, service searching, and service interoperability. XML has become the transport of data between applications over the internet. Web Service is a technology, a process and a phenomenon, which can be used to implement Service Oriented Architecture. XML based Web Services are becoming more insidious base technology for making applications to converse and exchange data in Service oriented architecture. According to the specification of web service nothing has been mentioned about its security. It is depending on the web security for its protection. Protection of web services in Cloud environment is the major concern of current research. Among the other risks of web services XDoS is the important issue. In this research paper, we have proposed and implemented an approach to mitigate DXDoS attack against Webservices using modified SOA and for IP Traceback Honey Bee algorithm is being used.

abstract={Modern cloud computing applications developed from different interoperable services that are interfacing with each other in a loose coupling approach. This work proposes the concept of the Virtual Machine (VM) cluster migration, meaning that services could be migrated to various clouds based on different constraints such as computational resources and better economical offerings. Since cloud services are instantiated as VMs, an application can be seen as a cluster of VMs that integrate its functionality. We focus on the VM cluster migration by exploring a more sophisticated method with regards to VM network configurations. In particular, networks are hard to managed because their internal setup is changed after a migration, and this is related with the configuration parameters during the re-instantiation to the new cloud platform. To address such issue, we introduce a Software Defined Networking (SDN) service that breaks the problem of network configuration into tractable pieces and involves virtual bridges instead of references to static endpoints. The architecture is modular, it is based on the SDN OpenFlow protocol and allows VMs to be paired in cluster groups that communicate with each other independently of the cloud platform that are deployed. The experimental analysis demonstrates migrations of VM clusters and provides a detailed discussion of service performance for different cases. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in Internet of Things (IoT) from centralized cloud computing to edge computing (or fog computing). Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However, existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing. In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits, including distributed processing, low latency, fault tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation behind Edge Mesh. Then, we describe in detail about the Edge Mesh computing paradigm, including the proposed software framework, research challenges, and benefits of Edge Mesh. We have also described the task management framework and done a preliminary study on task allocation problem in Edge Mesh. Different application scenarios, including smart home, intelligent transportation system, and healthcare, are presented to illustrate the significance of Edge Mesh computing paradigm. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Integrating the various embedded devices and systems in our environment enables an Internet of Things (IoT) for a smart city. The IoT will generate tremendous amount of data that can be leveraged for safety, efficiency and infotainment applications, and services for city residents. The management of this voluminous data through its lifecycle is fundamental to the realization of smart cities. Therefore, in contrast to existing surveys on smart cities we provide a data-centric perspective, describing the fundamental data management techniques employed to ensure consistency, interoperability, granularity and re-usability of the data generated by the underlying IoT for smart cities. Essentially, the data lifecycle in a smart city is dependent on tightly coupled data management with cross-cutting layers of data security and privacy, and supporting infrastructure. Therefore, we further identify techniques employed for data security and privacy, and discuss the networking and computing technologies that enable smart cities. We highlight the achievements in realizing various aspects of smart cities, present the lessons learnt and identify limitations and research challenges. IEEE},

abstract={With the popularity of many massive online courses (MOOCs) and relevant platforms such as the Coursera, edX and Udemy, open learning and education will obviously become a very influential and significant sector in education all over the world, especially for developing countries like China and India with large population sizes and huge demands for tertiary education to develop the knowledge-based economy. Due to the potentially large class sizes for courses on an open learning platform, it can be difficult to monitor each individual or averaged performance in each open learning course, thus possibly leading to a relatively higher dropout rate at the end of the course. This is where computationally intelligent methods such as the machine learning or learning analytics techniques may help to effectively monitor each individual or group performance in an open learning course. In this work, we propose a cloud-based and personalized learning platform enhanced by a very efficient and intelligent facial analytics algorithm to capture learners' real-time responses when viewing any open educational resources such as the Ted Talks, YouTube or MERLOT on mobile devices. After analyzing learners' instant responses and attention spans, it may help to quickly identify those difficult and/or less interesting topics. Besides, interactive quizzes can be flexibly added by course instructors into different sections of an online educational resource to evaluate each individual learner's actual level of understanding while relevant video files or course material is being streamed onto the learner's mobile device from the Dropbox cloud storage. All the data about the learning progress will be securely uploaded onto a password-protected cloud computing platform for further analyzes. Furthermore, the cloud platform ensures the interoperability of various mobile devices in this newly enhanced learning analytic system with which some initial and positive students' feedback was collected. This work clearly provides many promising directions for future extensions of the next-generation open learning and education platform. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud service description (CSD) becomes an active area which attracts the attention of many research organizations, while no standard CSD exists. This lack of standardization is caused by the vendor lock-in problem, where cloud providers use various techniques (languages, standards, ontologies, models, etc.) to describe cloud services. Furthermore, there are few studies which dealt with the four aspects of service especially the technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. Whereas, many other studies dealt only with some of these four aspects. This is the case of WSDL (Web Service Description Language) language, which focuses in the technical aspect, but it does not cover business and semantic ones. Our objective in this paper is to identify the foundations of a standardized CSD covering the technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. We present a comparative study of the different approaches that address CSD issues. The result of this comparative study shows that USDL (Unified Service Description Language) is the appropriate language supporting a service description by covering three aspects (technical, operational, and business), despite its inability to cover the semantic aspect. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The widespread diffusion of low-cost computing devices, such as Arduino boards and Raspberry Pi, along with improvements of Cloud computing platforms, are paving the way towards a whole new set of opportunities for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services. Varying degrees of intelligence are often required for supporting adaptation and self-management - yet, they should be provided in a light-weight, easy to use and customise, highly-interoperable way. Accordingly, in this paper we explore the idea of Logic Programming as a Service (LPaaS) as a novel and promising re-interpretation of distributed logic programming in the IoT era. After introducing the reference context and motivating scenarios of LPaaS as a key enabling technology for intelligent IoT, we define the LPaaS general system architecture. Then, we present a prototype implementation built on top of the tuProlog system, which provides the required interoperability and customisation. We showcase the LPaaS potential through a case study designed as a simplification of the motivating scenarios. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, along with the wide application of new generation information technologies (New IT) in manufacturing, many countries issued their national advanced manufacturing development strategies, such as Industrial Internet, Industry 4.0, and Made in China 2025. One common aim of these strategies is to achieve smart manufacturing, which demands the interoperation, integration, and fusion of the physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing. As well, New IT [such as Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, mobile Internet, and cyber-physical systems (CPS)] have played pivotal roles in promoting smart manufacturing. Data generated in the physical world can be sensed and transfered to the cyber world through IoT and the Internet, and be processed and analyzed by cloud computing, big data technologies to adjust the physical world. The physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing are integrated based on CPS. On the other hand, servitization has become a prominent trend in the manufacturing. Embracing the concept of ''Manufacturing-as-a-Service,'' manufacturing is provided as service for users. Because of the characteristics of interoperability and platform independence, services pave the way for large-scale smart applications and manufacturing collaboration. Combining New IT and services, this paper proposes a framework--New IT driven service-oriented smart manufacturing (SoSM). SoSM aims at facilitating the visions of smart manufacturing by making full use of New IT and services. Complementary to the framework of SoSM, the New IT driven typical characteristics of SoSM are also investigated and discussed, respectively. IEEE},

abstract={Recent developments in computing and networking are making it possible for a customer to benefit from the products of computing without the full investment in hardware, software, personnel and infrastructure. This is the main idea behind cloud computing. In this case, hardware, software and expert personnel can be centrally located and the 'services' they provide are accessed over the network. This leads to enhanced flexibility, better accessibility and scalability, and also to higher reliability in service provisioning from which both a service consumer and a service provider will benefit. Modelling and Simulation as a Service is a means of delivering value to customer via network cloud technology by enabling access to M&S applications, capabilities, and data without necessity of ownership. The service approach to Modelling and Simulation capabilities offers benefits like access to M&S services on demand, access to a broader set of applications and tools, sharing and pooling resources, models, data, best practices and other knowledge, which leads to more effective resources exploitation. The paper is based on NATO MSG-136 ('Modelling and Simulation (M&S) as a Service-'Rapid deployment of interoperable and credible simulation environments' group results. The paper, presenting some results achieved by the group, focuses on user's perspective of M&S as a Service (MSaaS), proposes more detailed classification of MSaaS stakeholders and considers some aspects of MSaaS support to Concept Development and Experimentation (CD&E) process on the national level. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of multiple clouds brings many advantages: cost optimization, Quality-of-Service (QoS) improvements, high availability, avoidance of vendor lock-in, disaster recovery and so on. However, currently the cloud vendor is largely proprietary and different cloud vendors have their own heterogeneous infrastructure, making it difficult for users to utilize resource from multiple cloud vendors. As a result, users have to manage distributed applications spanning multiple clouds and take into consideration the services migration for reasons like best cost efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Virtual Cloud and focus on the issues related to multi-cloud resource management in Virtual Cloud. Virtual Cloud is a customized cloud by aggregating resources and services of different clouds and aims to provide end users with a specific cloud working environment. It will ease users' burden of resource and distributed application management as well as the workload migration across cloud. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The volume and diversity of data in biomedical research have been rapidly increasing in recent years. While such data hold significant promise for accelerating discovery, their use entails many challenges including: the need for adequate computational infrastructure, secure processes for data sharing and access, tools that allow researchers to find and integrate diverse datasets, and standardized methods of analysis. These are just some elements of a complex ecosystem that needs to be built to support the rapid accumulation of these data. The NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative aims to facilitate digitally enabled biomedical research. Within the BD2K framework, the Commons initiative is intended to establish a virtual environment that will facilitate the use, interoperability, and discoverability of shared digital objects used for research. The BD2K Commons Framework Pilots Working Group (CFPWG) was established to clarify goals and work on pilot projects that address existing gaps toward realizing the vision of the BD2K Commons. This report reviews highlights from a two-day meeting involving the BD2K CFPWG to provide insights on trends and considerations in advancing Big Data science for biomedical research in the United States. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={There has been a shift in research towards the convergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms motivated by the need for IoT applications to leverage the unique characteristics of the cloud. IoT acts as an enabler to interconnect intelligent and self-configurable nodes “things” to establish an efficient and dynamic platform for communication and collaboration. IoT is becoming a major source of big data, contributing huge amounts of streamed information from a large number of interconnected nodes, which have to be stored, processed, and presented in an efficient, and easily interpretable form. Cloud computing can enable IoT to have the privilege of a virtual resources utilization infrastructure, which integrates storage devices, visualization platforms, resource monitoring, analytical tools, and client delivery. Given the number of things connected and the amount of data generated, a key challenge is the energy efficient composition and interoperability of heterogeneous things integrated with cloud resources and scattered across the globe, in order to create an on-demand energy efficient cloud based IoT application. In many cases, when a single service is not enough to complete the business requirement; a composition of web services is carried out. These composed web services are expected to collaborate towards a common goal with large amount of data exchange and various other operations. Massive data sets have to be exchanged between several geographically distributed and scattered services. The movement of mass data between services influences the whole application process in terms of energy consumption. One way to significantly reduce this massive data exchange is to use fewer services for a composition, which need to be created to complete a business requirement. Integrating fewer services can result in a reduction in data interchange, which in return helps in reducing the energy consumption and carbon footprint. This paper develops a novel multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm called (E2C2) that aims at creating an energy-aware composition plan by searching for and integrating the least possible number of IoT services, in order to fulfil user requirements. A formal user requirements translation and transformation modelling and analysis is adopted for the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated against four established service composition algorithms in multiple cloud environments (All clouds, Base cloud, Smart cloud, and COM2), with the results demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Public Administration sector in modern society is characterized by the need to simplify and streamline how to provide services to citizens and business. The enactment of e-government services has been a valuable solution that, thanks to cloud computing, has also ensured greater efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and interoperability. However, such approach creates new challenges for security and trust. In this scenario the paper describes a security framework that implements a centralized access control, providing authentication and authorization to a wide range of Web applications and services delivered by Public Administration and deployed in the cloud. Authentication occurs according to the SSO federated pattern that assumes the use of remote Identity Providers for login. To this end we decided to leverage the Public Digital Identity System (SPID), a security infrastructure that ensures to citizens and enterprises to be uniquely recognized. Federation is realized according to SPID specifications which rely on the SAML standard, while the interaction between the security framework and the applications/services to be protected is mainly enforced via the OAuth2/OpenID Connect protocol, but, to ensure a smooth transition of existing applications to the cloud, additional proprietary methods have been taken into account. © 2017 IEEE.},

However, seamless cloud interoperability is the complex issue, especially when different cloud platforms are interconnected. One of the major aspects of federating clouds resources is network federation. Federated networks must deal not only with heterogeneous cloud platforms, but also with different virtualization technologies and the added complexity of multi-layer virtualization. In order to allow monitoring and analysis of the complex heterogeneous environment, there is a need to present a user with the full aggregated view of the federated network including cloud interconnect and with the match between different layers and platforms. In this paper we present a framework that uses Skydive tool for network monitoring and analysis in BEACON federated network environment. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The explosive proliferation of smart devices and cloud computing has ushered the era of Cyberphysical Systems (CPS), a congruence of physical dynamical systems with the cyberspace. The success of deploying an Internet of Things (IoT) interconnecting billions of devices relies heavily upon making the right choices in revisiting traditional architectures for networked control and information processing. Inspired by the concept of Software Defined Systems (SDSys), we propose a control architecture for cyberphysical systems and discuss its advantages in terms of scalability, robustness, security, flexibility, and interoperability. The proposed architecture explicitly leverages the fact that agents possess computational units that may be used for in-network processing and decentralized control actions. We integrate a set of components such as sensors, actuators, access points and coordinators and specify the communication flow, the data flow, and the control flow in a programmable fashion. Control is spread over multiple layers (self-controllers, coordinators, local area controllers, and super-controllers) that form a hierarchy with added autonomy for distributed and decentralized actions. A middleware layer is integrated into the proposed design with several services and units to account for real-time operations in highly dynamic environments. We proceed to identify a wide range of potential vulnerabilities to cyberattacks at all levels, and propose solutions for effective resilience, detection and recovery. The proposed architecture aims at a holistic view with increased adaptability, where the controllers efficiently collaborate to quickly capture and respond to abnormal situations in a self-adjusting manner. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Software technology design, implementation, deployment, runtime verification, and experimental evaluation are of paramount importance for satisfying not only the functional but also the non-functional properties of distributed systems. Among the many different software layers in a system, the communication middleware is critical to provide overall efficiency and interoperability among heterogeneous systems. The increasing complexity of current and future distributed systems requires that middleware solutions be carefully designed to meet essential properties such as timeliness, efficiency, reliability, and scalability. In this paper, we describe the challenges and the role of software technologies and communication middleware for reliable distributed systems. We provide a short, non-exhaustive survey in the context of systems with varying non-functional requirements such as cyber-physical system, mobility, and cloud, with the primary objective of exposing some of the main challenges that these systems bring to the design and operation of middleware. Finally, we present a set of contributions that make up a new special issue on the middleware for reliable systems, which represent a fresh perspective on the state-of-the-art solutions that approach the problem of reliable software technologies and communication middleware from complementary view points. © 2017},

abstract={With a growing number of infrastructure cloud services, there are many benefits to interconnecting several clouds. However, seamless cloud interoperability is highly desired but not yet easily attainable in the current cloud solutions market. In this paper we address the problem of network monitoring and analysis in a complex federated network environment. Federated cloud networks deal not only with heterogeneous cloud platforms (i.e. OpenStack, AWS, Azure), but also with different virtualization technologies. Moreover, federation of the networks adds complexity, because in addition to the physical infrastructure and virtual networks dimensions, there is a dimension of the federated overlay network spread across clouds. To allow monitoring and analysis of the complex heterogeneous environment, it is not enough to see separate clouds. The user should see full aggregated view of the federated network including cloud interconnect and the match between network segments in different clouds. Moreover, when different SDN controllers deployed in the federated cloud, usual approach of collecting, exposing each individual network metric is often not relevant. In order to analyze packets forwarding there is a need to know how all the network interfaces are linked together and how they are related. Our approach to the network monitoring in a federated cloud environment uses Skydive [1], which collects in a distributed fashion all the network information and stores all the modifications. This approach allows bringing a network topology view with all the interfaces and their links, as well as the ability to capture network ows at any point of time. In this paper we address the general federated cloud architecture presented in [2]. The solution shown in Figure 1 contains two main components: Network Federation Agent (NFA) responsible for control and management plane of the federated network solution, negotiation of network sharing with peer NFAs and configuring data plane - Federated Datapath (FDP). FDP is responsible for data plane representing federation tunnels endpoint for the local data and control plane entities, acting as \the gateway to the federation". NFA and FDP, deployed in each cloud, create federated network by connecting network segments from different clouds. The Skydive monitoring tool relies on a fully distributed architecture leveraging two components: the Agents, acting as distributed probes, and the Analyzers, collecting and aggregating data from Agents. The Agents make use of topology probes in order to fill their version of the federated cloud graph. The Agents also ensure that relations between resources collected by probes are correctly reported in the graph. While Agents keep the last version of the topology they use the pub/sub capability to forward all the modifications to Analyzers which keep the aggregated information. As shown in the Figure 1, the Skydive agents are deployed at each hypervisor in every cloud monitoring the traffic between hosted VMs. The analyzers are deployed at the NFAs at each cloud. For the completeness of view, it is crucial to monitor the Federation tunnel connecting the clouds. Skydive agents deployed at the ends of the tunnels come with a ow classifier, supporting different encapsulation types, addressing the most common network virtualization environments and supporting multiple levels of encapsulation. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Testing as a Service (TaaS) is a new business and service model that provides efficient and effective software quality assurance and enables the use of a cloud for the meeting of quality standards, requirements and consumer's needs. However, problems that limit the effective use of TaaS involve lack of standardization in writing, execution, configuration and management of tests and lack of portability and interoperability among TaaS platforms - the so-called lock-in problem. The lock-in problem is a serious threat to software testing in the cloud and may become critical when a provider decides to suddenly increase prices, or shows serious technical availability problems. This paper proposes a novel approach for solving the lock-in problem in TaaS with the use of design patterns.

abstract={This conceptual paper aims to bring the fusion of emerging technologies and available data in order to gain insights and use them efficiently at the time of natural crisis. The global displacement scale due to disasters between 2008 and 2014 stands at an alarming rate of over 25 million lives on an average. Chennai floods 2015 has been the trigger for us to visualize the disaster management issue in various dimensions and come up with an approach by leveraging emerging technologies which has the potential to disseminate alerts seamlessly. The objective is to put forth some ideas on utilizing the existing information databases and signals from prevailing alert systems and integrate it using emerging technologies by leveraging the power of digital forces such as Mobility, Social media and Analytics. The proposed conceptual architecture could get data of various types and alerts in real time, process data streams and group them based on metadata and alert appropriate stakeholders. This proposed conceptual system based on the secondary research highlights how the benefits could be taken to various stakeholders such as government authorities, volunteers, media, residents of the disaster prone area and local authorities in those areas. The digital forces such as mobility, cloud computing, analytics and social media are fast emerging and the computing resources are available at a much lower costs almost like a commodity. This paper also leaves room for futuristic research in the IT technologies and their interoperability, performing analytics on the available inputs at the time of crisis and maximize the benefit to society and also emphasizes on smart integrated communication using cutting edge IT technologies. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={More and more companies rely on cloud services to provide their online software solutions. Cloud services are offered by a multitude of providers, each of them offering services through proprietary, mostly incompatible interfaces. Developing applications employing these vendor specific interfaces can create the vendor lock-in problem (i.e the application is tightly coupled to the underlying cloud provider). Consequently, such applications cannot be ported without incurring significant costs and time delay. A cloud services consumer can decide to switch to a different cloud provider based on different criteria such as changes in business requirements, continuously evolving offerings from cloud providers and costs control. Maintaining the flexibility to change cloud providers in an efficient way can be a challenging task. We propose an efficient model-driven framework for cloud application portability. Our approach enables applications consuming REST resources in the cloud to be transferred to different cloud providers without the need to refactor the applications. The framework supports a wide range of cloud resources. The framework produces an intermediation layer which translates the calls between the format of the initial cloud platform and the new target cloud platform. The intermediation layer can be consumed by any programming language. We demonstrate that cloud application portability can be achieved. Our solution successfully maps cloud-based services with an overall median of 100% for requests, and 74.8% for responses. Furthermore, we show that the intermediation layer introduces minimal additional latency. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={NATO and the nations use distributed simulation environments for various purposes, such as training, mission rehearsal, and decision support in acquisition processes. Consequently, modeling and simulation (M&S) has become a critical technology for the coalition and its nations. Achieving interoperability between participating simulation systems and ensuring credibility of results currently often requires enormous effort with regards to time, personnel, and budget. Recent technical developments in the area of cloud computing technology and service oriented architecture (SOA) may offer opportunities to better utilize M&S capabilities in order to satisfy NATO critical needs. A new concept that includes service orientation and the provision of M&S applications via the as-a-service model of cloud computing may enable composable simulation environments that can be deployed rapidly and on-demand. This new concept is known as M&S as a Service (MSaaS). There has also been the recent emergence of containerization as an alternative to virtualization. Containerization is the process of creating, packaging, distributing, deploying, and executing applications in a lightweight and standardized process execution environment known as a container. Because containers are, in principle, lightweight, they are suitable to serve as the vehicle for the provision of packaged (micro)services. Service orientation is an approach to the design of heterogeneous, distributed systems in which solution logic is structured in the form of interoperating services. This paper investigates various aspects of service orientation and containerization including simulation composition, networking, discovery, scalability, and overall performance. This investigation provides background information on the topics of service orientation, containerization, and Docker – a technology ecosystem for working with containers. A case study is presented for the use of Docker in support of a training simulation based on the high level architecture (HLA). The HLA is an IEEE standard architecture for distributed simulation environments that was originally developed for defense applications. The case study introduces a number of training use cases, and shows how Docker can be used to assist in their implementation. The performance impact of running a simulation within container technology is also investigated. The application of container technology to HLA-based simulations as presented in this paper is novel. The motivation for looking at this topic stems from the activity being conducted within NATO MSG-136. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={The National Flood Interoperability Experiment (NFIE) was an undertaking that initiated a transformation in national hydrologic forecasting by providing streamflow forecasts at high spatial resolution over the whole country. This type of large-scale, high-resolution hydrologic modeling requires flexible and scalable tools to handle the resulting computational loads. While high-throughput computing (HTC) and cloud computing provide an ideal resource for large-scale modeling because they are cost-effective and highly scalable, nevertheless, using these tools requires specialized training that is not always common for hydrologists and engineers. In an effort to facilitate the use of HTC resources the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project, CI-WATER, has developed a set of Python tools that can automate the tasks of provisioning and configuring an HTC environment in the cloud, and creating and submitting jobs to that environment. These tools are packaged into two Python libraries: CondorPy and TethysCluster. Together these libraries provide a comprehensive toolkit for accessing HTC to support hydrologic modeling. Two use cases are described to demonstrate the use of the toolkit, including a web app that was used to support the NFIE national-scale modeling. © 2016 American Water Resources Association},

abstract={Every industry is adopting Cloud Computing platform due to its low cost services and zero overheads of maintenance and upgrades. Several new issues are generated because of this wide adoption which are concern to both cloud service provider and cloud service users. Cloud service providers are facing the issue of resource limitations. Cloud service users are facing the issue of vendor lock-in. Federated Cloud through brokering can be used to solve the above mentioned issues. Cloud Federation is the place where cloud service providers can gather to share their resources and the cloud service consumers can buy those resources. The federation is either handled by one of the cloud service provider or a third party known as cloud service broker. The broker is solely responsible for providing services to the cloud consumers which are leased by cloud service providers. In this paper, we are proposing a framework for federated cloud based on the broker. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Abstract The need for storage and instant access to personal data (patient or professional) in Moroccan healthcare is exponential. Thus, the access needs of health professionals to different health information necessitate continuity of care, hence an architecture based on the concept of the cloud proves necessary. Considering the increasing demands placed on healthcare providers for infrastructure, systems and support, cloud computing will be the appropriate solution to meet the needs for care coordination, collaboration and communication between the different actors in the field Of health. Cloud Computing represents an evolution of information systems. Cloud computing brings a new approach to computing, a different way of using computer resources. This development has given existence to several providers offering multiple services. Then, Cloud end users are faced with the choice of the appropriate provider in terms of supported technologies, security and access rules. So, the sector aims to create a solution that works for all types of medical facilities, be it hospitals, health centers, clinics, private health care providers. In this paper, we propose a solution based on the use of a cloud broker in an inter-cloud environment in order to allow the technological renewal of our infrastructure while reducing the time of access to the services requested by the users, the dissipation of the energy And the number of physical servers installed. Evaluation results demonstrate that our architecture achieve good performance. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.},

This topology apply to monitor and control the provision of nutrition hydroponics, accessible as a Cloud SaaS. From the test results, average node response time needed to connect and communicate with IoT Cloud system (online) is 7.21 seconds. The time required to declare offline state of a node is 21.55 seconds. The test results of Cloud IoT (broker), obtained that number of nodes for each level QoS, affecting resource usage of CPU and throughput. The highest resource usage of CPU is 19% of 2.0GHz and throughput TX/RX is 34.68KBps/49.4KBps.

In this report we identify an isomorphic map between VCF and the reference Resource Description Framework. RDF is advanced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to enable representations of linked data that are both distributed and discoverable. The resulting ability to decompose VCF reports of genomic variation without loss of context addresses the need to modularize and govern NGS pipelines for Precision Medicine. Specifically, it provides the flexibility (i.e. The indexing) needed to support the wide variety of clinical scenarios and patient-facing governance where only part of the VCF data is fitting. © 2017 The Author.},

abstract={Multi-cloud systems have been gaining popularity due to the several benefits of the multi-cloud infrastructure such as lower level of vendor lock-in and minimize the risk of widespread data loss or downtime. Thus, the multi-cloud infrastructure enhances the dependability of the cloud-based system. However, it also poses many challenges such as nonstandard and inherent complexity due to different technologies, interfaces, and services. Consequently, it is a challenging task to design multi-cloud dependable systems. Virtualization is the key technology employed in the development of cloud-based systems. Docker has recently introduced its container-based virtualization technology for the development of software systems. It has newly launched a distributed system development tool called Swarm, which allows the development of a cluster of multiple Swarm nodes on multiple clouds. Docker Swarm has also incorporated several dependability attributes to support the development of a multi-cloud dependable system. However, making Swarm cluster always available requires minimum three active manager nodes which can safeguard one failure. This essential condition for the dependability is one of the main limitations because if two manager nodes fail suddenly due to the failure of their hosts, then Swarm cluster cannot be made available for routine operations. Therefore, this paper proposes an intuitive approach based on Computational Intelligence (CI) for enhancing its dependability. The proposed CI-based approach predicts the possible failure of the host of a manager node by observing its abnormal behaviour. Thus, this indication can automatically trigger the process of creating a new manager node or promoting an existing node as a manager for enhancing the dependability of Docker Swarm. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Various forms of cloud computing principles and technologies are becoming important recently. This paper addresses cloud computing for automation and control applications. It's argued that the open Internet cloud idea has such limitations that its not appropriate for automation. Since automation is physically and geographically local, it is inevitable to introduce the concept of local automation clouds. It's here proposed that local automation clouds should be self contained an be able to execute the intended automation functionalities without any external resources. Thus providing a fence at the rim of the local cloud preventing any inbound or outbound communication. Such a local cloud provides possibilities to address key requirements of both todays and future automation solutions. Adding mechanisms for secure inter-cloud administration and data tranfere enables local automation cloud to meet IoT automation system requirements as: 1) Interoperability of a wide range of IoT and legacy devices 2) Automation requirement on latency guarantee/prediction for communication and control computations. 3) Scalability of automation systems enabling very large integrated automation systems 4) Security and related safety of automation systems 5) Ease of application engineering 6) Multi stakeholder integration and operations agility. How these requirements can be met in such a local automation cloud is discussed with references to proposed solutions. The local automation cloud concept is further verified for a compartment climate control application. The control application included an IoT controller, four IoT sensors and actuators, and a physical layer communication gateway. The gateway acted as host for local cloud core functionalities. The climate control application has successfully been implemented using the open source Arrowhead Framework and its supports for design and implementation of self contained local automation clouds. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Simulation represents a powerful technique for the analysis of dependability and performance aspects of distributed systems. For large-scale critical systems, simulation demands complex experimentation environments and the integration of different tools, in turn requiring sophisticated modeling skills. Moreover, the criticality of the involved systems implies the set-up of expensive testbeds on private infrastructures. This paper presents a middleware for performing hybrid simulation of large-scale critical systems. The services offered by the middleware allow the integration and interoperability of simulated and emulated subsystems, compliant with the reference interoperability standards, which can provide greater realism of the scenario under test. The hybrid simulation of complex critical systems is a research challenge due to the interoperability issues of emulated and simulated subsystems and to the cost associated with the scenarios to set up, which involve a large number of entities and expensive long running simulations.

abstract={Current PaaS platforms enable single or hybrid cloud deployments. However, such deployment types cannot best cover the user application requirements as they do not consider the great variety of services offered by different cloud providers and the effects of vendor lock-in. On the other hand, multi-cloud deployment enables selecting the best possible service among equivalent ones providing the best trade-off between performance and cost. In addition, it avoids cases of service level deterioration due to service under-performance as main effects of vendor lock-in. While many multi-cloud application deployment research prototypes have been proposed, such prototypes do not examine the effect that deployment decisions have on application performance. As such, they blindly attempt to satisfy low-level hardware requirements by neglecting the impact of allocation decisions on higher-level requirements at the component or application level. To this end, this paper proposes a new IaaS selection algorithm which, apart from being able to satisfy both low and high level requirements of different types, it also exploits deployment knowledge offered via reasoning over previous application execution histories to take the best possible allocation decisions. The experimental evaluation clearly shows that by considering this extra knowledge, more optimal deployment solutions are derived, able to maintain the service levels requested by users, in less solving time. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Scientific workflows are increasingly being migrated to the Cloud. However, workflow developers face the problem of which Cloud to choose and, more importantly, how to avoid vendor lock-in. This is because there are a range of Cloud platforms, each with different functionality and interfaces. In this paper we propose a solution - a system that allows workflows to be portable across a range of Clouds. This portability is achieved through a new framework for building, dynamically deploying and enacting workflows. It combines the TOSCA specification language and container-based virtualization. TOSCA is used to build a reusable and portable description of a workflow which can be automatically deployed and enacted using Docker containers. We describe a working implementation of our framework and evaluate it using a set of existing scientific workflows that illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing enables enterprises to realise significant cost savings whilst accelerating the development of new innovative applications. Nevertheless, due to security concerns, enterprises are reluctant to migrate their operations to the cloud. In addition, the proliferation of cloud services transforms the enterprise IT environment into a complex ecosystem of collaborating services. One way to tame this complexity and alleviate the security concerns is to rely on policies that regulate the deployment, delivery and governance of cloud services. However, the heterogeneity inherent in such services, coupled with the dynamic nature of cloud environments, hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable policies. This paper proposes a generic framework for the definition and representation of policies that are enforceable across diverse administrative domains and are amenable to automated correctness checks. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The diversity in the way different cloud providers offer their services, give their SLAs, present their QoS, support different technologies, etc., complicates the portability and interoperability of cloud applications, and favors vendor lockin. Standards like TOSCA, and tools supporting them, have come to help in the provider-independent description of cloud applications. After the variety of proposed cross-cloud application management tools, we propose going one step further in the unification of cloud services with a deployment tool in which IaaS and PaaS services are integrated into a unified interface. We provide support for applications whose components are to be deployed on different providers, indistinctly using IaaS and PaaS services. The TOSCA standard is used to define a portable model describing the topology of the cloud applications and the required resources in an agnostic, and providers- and resourcesindependent way.We include in this paper some highlights on our implementation on Apache Brooklyn and present a non-trivial example that illustrates our approach. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={With the advent of Cloud Computing, organizations are increasingly migrating their information and communication technology (ICT) resources to the cloud. This has recently gained a great attention because of cloud pay-as-you-go model which drastically reduces actual IT infrastructure with high performance and continuous availability. In order to effectively utilize existing cloud resources, organizations may look for available cloud resources from different cloud providers. However, cloud resources are heterogeneous and described by different standards which prevents an easy and dynamic interoperability between organizations. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework tackling this heterogeneity issue. We develop a set of ontologies to semantically represent cloud resources by looking at three cloud resource description standards: Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA), Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), and Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI). Hence, our framework promotes the creation of a common semantic knowledge base of cloud resources described using these different standards. This knowledge base allows a seamless translation of cloud providers' resource descriptions. We developed an application to validate our approach as a proof of concept. We also evaluated the feasibility and completeness of our semantic framework on use cases obtained from standard specifications. © 2016 IEEE.},

In the process of providing better services for customers, cloud service providers have developed proprietary standards on how cloud application interacts with their cloud. This has been limiting the cloud adoption because of the vendor lock-in and portability issues. The need for the business application on clouds to be interoperable is increasing. The cloud federation would be the solution in providing on demand resources and better scalability. The IEEE cloud computing working standard groups have certain standards to build interoperable cloud environment.

abstract={Compared to traditional medical services provided within hospitals, m-Health monitoring systems (MHMSs) face more challenges in personalised health data processing. To achieve personalised and high-quality health monitoring by means of new technologies, such as mobile network and cloud computing, in this paper, a framework of an m-Health monitoring system based on a cloud computing platform (Cloud-MHMS) is designed to implement pervasive health monitoring. Furthermore, the modules of the framework, which are Cloud Storage and Multiple Tenants Access Control Layer, Healthcare Data Annotation Layer, and Healthcare Data Analysis Layer, are discussed. In the data storage layer, a multiple tenant access method is designed to protect patient privacy. In the data annotation layer, linked open data are adopted to augment health data interoperability semantically. In the data analysis layer, the process mining algorithm and similarity calculating method are implemented to support personalised treatment plan selection. These three modules cooperate to implement the core functions in the process of health monitoring, which are data storage, data processing, and data analysis. Finally, we study the application of our architecture in the monitoring of antimicrobial drug usage to demonstrate the usability of our method in personal healthcare analysis. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Each cloud infrastructure-As-A-service (IaaS) provider offers its own set of virtual machine (VM) images and hypervisors. This creates a vendor lock-in problem when cloud users try to change cloud provider (CP). Although, recently a few user-side inter-cloud migration techniques have been proposed (e.g. nested virtualisation), these techniques do not provide dynamic cloud management facilities which could help users to decide whether or not to proceed with migration, when and where to migrate, etc. Such decision-making support in the post-deployment phase is crucial when the current CP's Quality of Service (QoS) degrades while other CPs offer better QoS or the same service at a lower price. To ensure that users' required QoS constraints are achieved, dynamic monitoring and management of the acquired cloud services are very important and should be integrated with the inter-cloud migration techniques. In this paper, we present the problem formulation and the architecture of a Multi-objective dYnamic MIgratioN Decision makER (MyMinder) framework that enables users to monitor and appropriately manage their deployed applications by providing decisions on whether to continue with the currently selected CP or to migrate to a different CP.

abstract={The heterogeneity of cloud computing platforms hinders the proper exploitation of cloud technologies since it prevents interoperability, promotes vendor lock-in and makes it very difficult to exploit the well-engineered security mechanisms made available by cloud providers. In this paper, we introduce a technique to help developers to specify and enforce access control policies in cloud applications. The main idea is twofold. First, use a high-level specification language with a formal semantics that allows to answer access requests abstracting from an access control mechanism available in a particular cloud platform. Second, exploit an automated translation mechanism to compute (equivalent) policies that can be enforced in two of the most widely used cloud platforms: AWS and Openstack.We illustrate the technique on a running example and report our experience with a prototype implementation. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.},

abstract={The use of virtual machines (VMs) in Cloud computing provides various benefits in the overall software engineering lifecycle. These include efficient elasticity mechanisms resulting in higher resource utilization and lower operational costs. The VMs as software artifacts are created using provider-specific templates, called virtual machine images (VMI), and are stored in proprietary or public repositories for further use. However, some technology-specific choices can limit the interoperability among various Cloud providers and bundle the VMIs with nonessential or redundant software packages, leading to increased storage size, prolonged VMI delivery, stagnant VMI instantiation, and ultimately vendor lock-in. To address these challenges, we present a set of novel functionalities and design approaches for efficient operation of distributed VMI repositories, specifically tailored for enabling (1) simplified creation of lightweight and size optimized VMIs tuned for specific application requirements; (2) multi-objective VMI repository optimization; and (3) efficient reasoning mechanism to help optimizing complex VMI operations. The evaluation results confirm that the presented approaches can enable VMI size reduction by up to 55%, while trimming the image creation time by 66%. Furthermore, the repository optimization algorithms can reduce the VMI delivery time by up to 51% and cut down the storage expenses by 3%. Moreover, by implementing replication strategies, the optimization algorithms can increase the system reliability by 74%. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

However, the lack of standardisation and migration tools makes it difficult for users to migrate to another Cloud Service Provider (CSP) without losing contacts, thus resulting in a vendor lock-in problem. In this work, we aim at providing a generic framework, named PortableCloud, that is flexible enough to enable users to migrate seamlessly to a different CSP keeping all their data and contacts. To preserve the privacy of users, the data in the portable cloud is concealed from the CSP by employing encryption techniques. Moreover, we introduce a migration agent that assists users in automatically finding a suitable CSP that can satisfy their needs. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The trading of virtual machines, storage and other Cloud Computing resources on commodity exchanges has generated considerable interest from both academia and the financial services market. With multiple sellers providing appropriately equivalent virtual machines they become fungible, offering the opportunity for users to swap instances from one seller with instances from another when required, easing concerns over vendor lock-in, availability and provider failure. However, heterogeneity in the hardware from which they are provisioned is likely inevitable, given heterogeneity already found on a number of Public Clouds, where it results in performance variation across instances of the same type, and consequently variation in Cloud costs at the same price. To address this problem we propose a Cloud Service Broker (CSB) that acquires and re-sells instances on the basis of their current performance. The service reduces performance risk for users, but comes at a cost. We determine the average markup the CSB must add to the base instance price to cover the costs of operating a pool capable of satisfying a given proportion of requests. We show how increases in heterogeneity on the underlying commodity exchange lead to lower costs for the CSB, and that the largest degree of heterogeneity we consider, on the basis of real-world findings, leads to the best outcome: an average markup of just 12% on the buy price from the exchange will satisfy 95% of requests. This creates opportunities for CSB profitability to be explored on the basis of selling performance-assured instances at prices that will account for this markup. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents an iterative mathematical decision model for organizations to evaluate whether to invest in establishing information technology (IT) infrastructure on-premises or outsourcing IT services on a multicloud environment. This is because a single cloud cannot cover all types of users' functional/nonfunctional requirements, in addition to several drawbacks such as resource limitation, vendor lock-in, and prone to failure. On the other hand, multicloud brings several merits such as vendor lock-in avoidance, system fault tolerance, cost reduction, and better quality of service. The biggest challenge is in selecting an optimal web service composition in the ever increasing multicloud market in which each provider has its own pricing schemes and delivers variation in the service security level. In this regard, we embed a module in the cloud broker to log service downtime and different attacks to measure the security risk. If security tenets, namely, security service level agreement, such as availability, integrity, and confidentiality for mission-critical applications, are targeted by cybersecurity attacks, it causes disruption in business continuity, leading to financial losses or even business failure. To address this issue, our decision model extends the cost model by using the cost present value concept and the risk model by using the advanced mean failure cost concept, which are derived from the embedded module to quantify cloud competencies. Then, the cloud economic problem is transformed into a bioptimization problem, which minimizes cost and security risks simultaneously. To deal with the combinatorial problem, we extended a genetic algorithm to find a Pareto set of optimal solutions. To reach a concrete result and to illustrate the effectiveness of the decision model, we conducted different scenarios and a small-to-medium business IT development for a 5-year investment as a case study. The result of different implementation shows that multicloud is a promising and reliable solution against IT on-premises deployment. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Despite many benefits, concerns around security and privacy challenges in cloud are on the rise. In this paper we have developed a cloud security and privacy taxonomy which is used to capture the traditional security challenges with the divergence cloud technology. The content analysis revealed that cloud security and privacy inherits most of the challenges existing in traditional security, however it also introduces several new challenges around virtualization, trust, legal, privacy and data interoperability issues. The paper identifies also the gaps found in literature around Security as a Service. Finally, it introduces Privacy-by-Design (PbD) framework integrated with cloud security. We developed a control matrix based on the literature review integrated with PbD to offer organizations, developer, business architects, and decision makers a mechanism for assessing security and privacy concerns before adopting a new cloud solution. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Cloud computing has transformed the computing landscape by enabling flexible compute-resource provisioning. The rapid growth of cloud computing and its large-scale nature provide many advantages to business enterprises. Lack of trust in cloud services however remains a major barrier to the adoption of cloud computing. Trust issues typically relate to concerns about the location, protection and privacy of data. The concept of trust includes trust in both novel technologies and cloud service providers and is composed of both persistent and dynamic trust elements. We have previously developed a trust label system that is capable of facilitating both persistent and dynamic trust building in both cloud services and cloud service providers; however, it lacks reliable information delivery mechanisms. The Cloud Trust Protocol (CTP) aims to provide a reliable information communication system for cloud service consumers and thus offers a natural complement to the trust label system by providing a reliable and interoperable information exchange mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel integration of the trust label system with CTP to provide end-To-end visibility of cloud service operational information to consumers. ©2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={NASA Langley Research Center identified a need for a distributed simulation architecture that enables collaboration of live, virtual, and constructive nodes across its local area network with extensibility to other NASA Centers and external partners. One architecture that was prototyped and evaluated employed Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware and the GovCloud cloud computing service. The nodes used DDS to exchange data. GovCloud was added as a potential solution to enable other Centers and external partners to join the distributed simulation through an existing trusted network, removing the need to establish case-by-case interconnection security agreements. The prototype architecture was applied to an airspace simulation of manned and unmanned vehicles exchanging Auto-Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADSB) messages. Various configurations of nodes were run and evaluated to assess the architecture with respect to upfront investment to augment a node for the architecture, integration and interoperability of nodes, performance, and connectivity and security. ©2017 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={The international healthcare systems interoperability is an unresolved technological area at the moment. This paper demonstrates the results of the software engineering research for simplex syntactic and semantic technical interoperability of hospital information systems, eHealth smart device technology and clinical telemedicine instruments through the recently developed Telemedicine Interoperability Hub. Several similar experiments exist. This research is unique in building a prototype interconnecting not only healthcare information systems with each other, but aiming to establish a general healthcare interoperability scheme including also the eHealth smart devices and telemedicine instruments. The aim of this research is to establish cloud-based data interchange capability with the newly developed information technology system interconnected with the emerging eHealth Internet of Things solutions and the classical hospital information system architecture. Notwithstanding the international information technology medical data exchange standards, like Health Level Seven, the adoption of an industry-wide open telemedicine syntactic and semantic interoperability standard is necessary. The research studied varying simplex, duplex, full-duplex, data package- and file-based information technology modalities establishing stable system interconnection among clinical instruments, healthcare systems and eHealth smart devices. This research is the manifestation of the trilateral cooperation of the University of Debrecen Department of Information Technology, Semmelweis University Second Paediatric Clinic and T-Systems Healthcare Competence Center Central and Eastern Europe. The developed experimental software engineering solution was embedded in hybrid cloud architecture after testing private cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Public Cloud Software-as-a-Service technical solutions. © 2017 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},

Stand-alone and web-based learning management systems (LMSs) have also limitations of adaptability for the nationwide e-assessment. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the interoperability, security and adaptability of e-assessment systems on the nationwide level. The Afghanistan research and education network (AfgREN) is considered as a case in this research. A requirements bazaar is used for gathering data about functional and non-functional requirements.

abstract={Virtual Organization (VO) represents a prominent collaboration initiative, where a set of entities share competencies and risks attending a common goal. Moreover, their interactions can be supported in an Internet basis, using Cloud Computing (CC) resources. The VO and CC integration brings several benefits, such as: Reduction of costs and maintenance, interoperability, among others. However, there are issues related to privacy, trust and security that need to be addressed. One of the issues observed is how much trust VO members put in the cloud provider (CP), particularly, in a scenario where VO members use the resources provided by a CP to made available their services and in order to interact with other members. Thus, the proposed reputation architecture intends to assist the decision-making processes present in the VO's life-cycle reputing CP trust. The reputed trust is based on two sources: A) objective (Quality of Service (QoS) indicators) and b) subjective (feedback from users regarding those QoS indicators). The evaluation results show that the architecture is resilient to attacks on subjective trust during the reputation calculation. Also, it is possible to note that the proposed architecture presents an acceptable average time for each one operation, and a significant role during VO's creation and operation. ©2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={In the cloud computing concept, users can use computing resources according to their needs and requirements. The cloud approach helps users to reduce the cost of IT infrastructure. To provide services, different cloud service providers build their own computing platform differently due to the lack of a common standard. Selecting the cloud provider from among these heterogeneous cloud environments is really challenging for users. Several brokering mechanisms have been proposed as an intermediate solution in the past few years. Cloud brokering helps users to select a cloud provider according to their needs and specific requirements. In this paper, we present the ongoing research and innovations pertaining to the cloud brokering mechanism by various researchers. We also investigate various approaches, future challenges and other obstacles to all the proposed brokering solutions. The main contribution of this paper is that it provides the first review concerning cloud brokering architecture, which will provide a better understanding of cloud brokering and identify the important research directions of this increasingly important area. Another contribution is that it depicts a unified cloud brokering architecture that can contribute to future research. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, the increase in commercial traffic, specifically in food industry, has a negative impact on the cost of logistics and environment. In other words, it has also an increased risk on quality, safety and food traceability. The development of traceability systems permits to reduce logistical risks in the food supply chains, given that identification, tracking and real-time monitoring in supply chains were always difficult tasks due to the heterogeneity of platforms and technologies. The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing has brought new approaches to collect, transfer, store and share information through improved cooperation and interoperability between logistics actors. In this work, an approach is proposed for the development of a food traceability system based on IoT technologies, cloud and fog computing to collect information and record events related to products anywhere in the supply chain. The goal is to satisfy users' requests in terms of condition, quality, and position of their products. Finally, a case study for a food contamination scenario is presented to illustrate the usefulness of our approach. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Platform as a service (PaaS) is one of the Cloud computing services that provide a computing platform in the Cloud, allowing customers to develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. The primary disadvantage for an SME to enter the emerging PaaS market is the possibility of being locked into a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants. The PaaSport project focuses on facilitating SMEs to deploy business applications on the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering and to seamlessly migrate these applications on demand, via a thin, non-intrusive Cloud-broker, in the form of a Cloud PaaS Marketplace. PaaSport enables PaaS provider SMEs to roll out semantically interoperable PaaS offerings, by annotating them using a unified PaaS semantic model that has been defined as an OWL ontology. In this paper we focus on the recommendation algorithm that has been developed on top of the ontology, for providing the application developer with recommendations about the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering. The algorithm consists of: a) a matchmaking part, where the functional parameters of the application are taken into account to rule out inconsistent offerings, and b) a ranking part, where the non-functional parameters of the application are considered to score and rank offerings. Τhe algorithm is extensively evaluated showing linear scalability to the number of offerings and application requirements. Furthermore, it is extensible upon future semantic model extensions, because it is agnostic to domain specific concepts and parameters, using SPARQL template queries. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The current dominant computing mode in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) domain is standalone based, causing fragmentation and fundamental interoperability problems. This makes the collaboration required to deal with the interconnected and complex tasks associated with a sustainable and resilient built environment extremely difficult. This article aims to discuss how the latest computing technologies can be leveraged for the AEC domain and Building Information Modelling (BIM) in particular. These technologies include Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics. The data rich BIM domain will be analysed to identify relevant characteristics, opportunities and the likely challenges. A clear case will be established detailing why BIM needs these technologies and how they can be brought together to bring about a paradigm shift in the industry. Having identified the potential application of new technologies, a future platform will be proposed. It will carry out large scale, real-time processing of data from all stakeholders. The platform will facilitate the collaborative interpretation, manipulation and analysis of data for the whole lifecycle of building projects. It will be flexible, intelligent and able to autonomously execute analysis and choose the relevant tools. This will form a base for a step-change for computing tools in the AEC domain. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.},

Nowadays, cloud-based solutions can support collaborative data science platforms and deliver all types of processing operations through the network service chain. In this article we deal with healthcare-related data management and exchange, and we propose security and privacy requirements together with a novel microservices approach. We investigate how cloud computing can be adopted within healthcare systems. The interoperability of existing technologies will improve the quality of life and the efficiency of healthcare systems by making them more personalized and centered on patients, together with reducing operational costs and medical errors. To have a socially acceptable health network service chain, the security and privacy issues need to be analyzed and addressed. We explore the the security and privacy requirements and implications, and also discuss existing methods, and in the end propose an architecture of a secure manager for cloud-based healthcare-related data management and exchange. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud platforms have evolved over the last years as means to provide value-Added services for Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, particularly smart home applications. From different use cases the necessity arises to connect IoT cloud solutions of different vendors. While some established platforms support an integration of other vendors' systems into their own infrastructure, solutions to federate IoT cloud platforms can hardly be found. In this paper, we analyze existing IoT cloud platforms with respect to their similarities and derive a concept of an Intercloud Broker (IB) that enables the establishment of an IoT Intercloud to support interoperability of cloud-based IoT platforms from different vendors. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach we evaluated the overhead introduced by the Intercloud Broker. As the results show, the IB can be implemented with minimal overhead in terms of throughput and delay even on commodity hardware. ©2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={A four-tier based Smart Home System is proposed in this paper; this type of network architecture is inspired by both the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) technologies. The main purpose of this structure is to establish a centralized resource management system, which can monitor and control each home appliance within a house. This aim and structure can help to overcome the most notable research challenge which is called interoperability of the system. The interoperability can be reflected from how other services such as assisted living and vehicle tracking are able to share and utilize the same resources. One of the structure advantages is to help existing house owners to live in a modern and convenient environment; it is also environmentally friendly by reducing the overall energy consumption within a household. A novel Home System Data Reflect Arc is proposed to minimalize the response time and limit unnecessary data transmission. Finally, with the aid and optimization of wireless sensor networks, a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based indoor localization approach is proposed which is novel based on the fact that it does not require specialized implementation, nor does it require people to wear specialized hardware as it is part of a passive device free environment. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017.},

abstract={In order for IoT application developers to deliver on the promise of IoT, new tools and methodologies addressing the challenges associated with development of highly distributed systems running on non-reliable and heterogeneous hardware are required. Some of the main characteristics of cloud computing that has been a driving force for its success, are resource pooling, elasticity and the capacity for combining unrelated services. We believe that a similar approach is needed for IoT as well. In this paper, we show how Calvin, an open source peer-to-peer platform for distributed applications, tackles many of the problems inherent in IoT. By only loosely associating the functionality of a device with a semantics, and having implementations based on conventions rather than pre-defined terminology, it is possible to let a system of Calvin run-times autonomously handle deployment decisions, and respond to changing requirements. We will discuss how to develop and deploy dynamic and adaptive IoT-applications based on capabilities and requirements, and how to resolve requirements by automatically combining information from multiple sources based on encapsulated domain knowledge. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The 'Big Data' paradigm will revolutionize understanding of the natural environment. New technologies are revolutionizing our ability to measure, model, understand and make robust, evidence-based predictions at increasingly spatial and temporal resolutions. Realising this potential will require reengineering of environmental sciences in the observation infrastructure, in data management and processing, and in the culture of environmental sciences. Collectively these will deliver vibrant, integrated research communities. Manipulating such enormous data streams requires a new data infrastructure underpinned by four technologies. Pervasive environmental sensor networks will continuously measure suites of environmental parameters and transmit these wirelessly to scientists, regulators and modellers in real time. Integrated environmental modelling will process data, streamed from sensor networks, using components synthesizing natural systems developed by domain experts, each of which will be linked at runtime to other expert developed components. Semantic interoperability will facilitate cross-disciplinary working, as has already happened within the biosciences so that data items can be exchanged with unambiguous, shared meaning. Cloud computing will revolutionize data processing allowing scalable computing close to observations on an as-needed basis. Leveraging the full potential of these technologies requires a major culture change in the environmental sciences where national and continental scale observatories of sensors networks become basic scientific tools. © The Geological Society of London 2017.},

This position paper describes a research thread on an extensible Domain Specific Language (DSL), a platform for the automated deployment, and a generic architecture of an ops application manager for self-adaptive distributed applications on hybrid cloud infrastructures. The idea is to overcome the cited limitations by empowering the cloud applications with self-configuration, self-healing, and self-protection capabilities. Such autonomous governance can be achieved by letting cloud users define their policies concerning security, data protection, dependability and functional compliance behavior using the proposed DSL. Real world trials in different application domains are discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The multitude of cloud providers and technologies diminish the interoperability and portability of applications by offering diverse and heterogeneous functionalities, APIs, and data models. Although there are integration technologies that provide uniform interfaces that wrap proprietary APIs, the differences regarding the services offered by providers, their functionality, and their management features are still major issues that impede portability. In this paper, we tackle these issues by introducing the SePaDe System, which is a pluggable deployment framework that abstracts from proprietary services, APIs, and data models in a new way: The system builds upon reusable archive templates that contain (i) a deployment model for a certain kind of application and (ii) all deployment and management logic required to provide defined functionalities and management features. Thus, by selecting appropriate templates, an application can be deployed on any infrastructure providing the specified features. We validate the practical feasibility of the approach by a prototypical implementation that is based on the TOSCA standard and present several case studies to evaluate its relevance. ©2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={With the integration and extensive applications for new generation of information technologies (such as cloud computing, internet of things, big data, mobile internet, artificial intelligence) in manufacturing industry, a number of countries had put forward their national advanced manufacturing development strategies, such as Industry 4.0 in Germany, Industrial Internet and manufacturing system based on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in USA, as well as Made in China 2025 and Internet Plus Manufacturing in China. Although each of these strategies was proposed under different circumstances, one of the common purposes of these strategies was to achieve the interconnection, interoperability between physical world and the information world of manufacturing and the intelligent operation of manufacturing. As one of bottlenecks to achieve this purpose, the communication and interaction between the physical world and the information world of manufacturing must be solved. To solve the problem, a novel concept of Digital Twin Workshop (DTW) based on digital twin was proposed. Complementary to the concept, the characteristics, architecture, system composition, operating mechanism and enabling key technologies were also elaborated and discussed respectively. On this basis, the theory and implementation of the communication and interaction between physical and information world of workshop based on workshop digital twin data were discussed. © 2017, Editorial Department of CIMS.

abstract={While the term Internet of Things (IoT) has been coined relatively recently, it has deep roots in multiple other areas of research including cyber-physical systems, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, embedded systems, mobile ad-hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, cellular networks, wearable computing, cloud computing, big data analytics, and intelligent agents. As the Internet of Things, these technologies have created a landscape of diverse heterogeneous capabilities and protocols that will require adaptive controls to effect linkages and changes that are useful to end users. In the context of military applications, it will be necessary to integrate disparate IoT devices into a common platform that necessarily must interoperate with proprietary military protocols, data structures, and systems. In this environment, IoT devices and data will not be homogeneous and provenance-controlled (i.e. single vendor/source/supplier owned). This paper presents a discussion of the challenges of integrating varied IoT devices and related software in a military environment. A review of contemporary commercial IoT protocols is given and as a practical example, a middleware implementation is proffered that provides transparent interoperability through a proactive message dissemination system. The implementation is described as a framework through which military applications can integrate and utilize commercial IoT in conjunction with existing military sensor networks and command and control (C2) systems. © 2017 SPIE.},

abstract={MSaaS (M&S as a Service) is gaining momentum as an effective approach to bring the benefits of service-oriented architectures and cloud computing into the M&S field, so as to enhance interoperability, composability, reusability and reduce the cost of M&S efforts. Such significant advantages can be further enhanced by introducing automated model transformations that support the various phases of a M&S effort, from simulation model building down to model implementation, deployment and execution. In previous contributions we have already addressed the use of automated model transformations that can be effectively adopted to provide simulation services for MSaaS platforms. This paper instead focuses on the automated development of modeling services for MSaaS, i.e., those services that allow platform users to easily build models in their own modeling language by use of a web-based user interface. Specifically, this work proposes an approach to automatically generate web-based visual editors from a metamodel that defines a given modeling language. Once generated, such editors can be made available on demand through a complete MSaaS platform, which also includes simulation services. The paper first describes the architecture of a MSaaS platform that includes modeling services, then illustrates the method for the automated development of web-based modeling services and, finally, gives a complete example application of the proposed method. ©2017 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={Medical science is in the current global healthcare sector where innovation based on information and communications technology produces major changes that have the effect of patient centeredness. Using Big Data solutions for the healthcare system as it is both an opportunity to improve the quality of medical performance and cost optimization. In this paper we aimed to analyse the impact of applying innovative technologies based on Big Data in diabetes management. The purpose of the study was to determine patients' perception on adoption of innovative technologies for the prevention, detection and treatment of diabetes as well as their involvement in establishing own treatment plans. The data we collected through a questionnaire, and we processed them with SPSS v.24. According to the results obtained, we found that patients are open to upgrading treatment and sharing of new treatments. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the need to shift from traditional medical system at mHealth system - the premise of applying innovative technologies based on Big Data, cloud computing and smart mobile devices. Through integration and interoperability of such disparate information, the decision support system and knowledge management system will have a digital archive and mechanisms that will allow the addition of a new dimension in the treatment of the disease by prevention and personalized treatment.},

abstract={Virtual desktops and virtual applications nowadays become popular in civil engineering companies. Current developments of software vendors trend to the outsourcing of the engineer's workstation to the cloud. However, in the foreseeable future companies will rely on hybrid environments where traditional tasks are handled by traditional applications and cloud platforms are used for more dynamical business areas. Furthermore, stakeholders in construction projects are geographically spread and work together only temporary. Traditional applications never were designed for this scenario. In this paper we introduce the BIMgrid, a work in progress to develop an innovative, adaptive infrastructure integration framework for civil engineering applications, based on private grid and public cloud resources. Although some middleware solutions for the efficient combination of hardware already exist, they are mostly based on UNIX and demand advanced technological knowledge to implement. We present our current state of work and give an overview about the architecture of the BIMgrid, the integration into an IT infrastructure, data management and the interfaces to use it's features with common applications. The prototype implementation is designed as a layered, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and offers several interfaces. Data Management in the BIMgrid will be based on vendor specific data formats and the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard and hence supports the interoperability between applications. Our prototype has been developed in several research projects and tested by industry partners under real conditions. We expect to reduce costs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through the automation of complex workflows, optimization of data transfer and reduction of the communication effort between stakeholders. Further we want to make benefits of grid and cloud computing accessible to companies, without dissipation of so far made hard- and software investments. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Big Data, Cloud computing and Data Science is the booming future of IT industries. The common thing among all the new techniques is that they deal with not just Data but Big Data. Users store various kinds of data on cloud repositories. Cloud Database Management System deals with these large sets of data. Cloud Database service provider deals with many obstacles while providing various service. Amongst all the challenges processing of large amount of data, interoperability and security are the major concerns that are explained in this study. Enhanced Generalized Query Processing through MapReduce (E-GENMR) is a prototype model that provides solution for these problems. Firstly, traditional approaches are not suitable for processing such gigantic amount of data as they are not able to handle such amount of data. Various solutions have been developed such as Hadoop, MapReduce Programming codes, HIVE, PIG etc. but these technologies don't provide solution for these problems at the same time and moreover users are not compatible with these latest technologies like MapReduce codes. EGENMR provides interoperability as it takes queries written in various RDBMS forms like SQL Server, ORACLE, DB2, MYSQL and convert into MapReduce codes as they are considered to be the efficient way for processing large data. Secondly, Client's data is stored in encrypted form and processing is done on this data hence it ensures the security aspect. Indexing plays a very important role in processing queries, in EGENMR indexing is implemented using closed double hashing technique. We compared various query processing time of E-GENMR for encrypted data and unencrypted data. A comparison of various queries has been done to evaluate the performance of E-GENMR with latest techniques like Hadoopdb, SQLMR, HIVE and PIG and it has been concluded that E-GENMR shows better performance. © 2017 Shweta Malhotra, Mohammad Najmud Doja, Bashir Alam and Mansaf Alam.},

SITCORE creates a virtual research development environment allowing collaboration from other locations, including DoD, industry, academia, and collation facilities. SITCORE combined with AODR provides end-toend algorithm development, experimentation, demonstration, and validation. The AODR enterprise allows the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), as well as other government organizations, industry, and academia to store and disseminate multiple intelligence (Multi-INT) datasets collected at field exercises and demonstrations, and to facilitate research and development (R and D), and advancement of analytical tools and algorithms supporting the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) community. The AODR provides a potential central repository for standards compliant datasets to serve as the "go-to" location for lessons-learned and reference products. Many of the AODR datasets have associated ground truth and other metadata which provides a rich and robust data suite for researchers to develop, test, and refine their algorithms. Researchers download the test data to their own environments using a sophisticated web interface. The AODR allows researchers to request copies of stored datasets and for the government to process the requests and approvals in an automated fashion.

abstract={Digital Technologies have become a driving force for change, transforming much of the way people live and work. This has revolutionized the way people communicate and interact with each other; the recent focus has been particularly on improving public access to information and services by displaced people, who have been affected by political instability. Implementing eService activities within unstable environments requires more attention to increase its availability, affordability and accessibility in an efficient and an effective way. The focus of this study is to shed light on elements that contribute to successful implementation of eService initiatives in such unstable environments. It utilises a qualitative research approach through adopting three case studies of eService activities from Syria (the source of the displaced people) and Turkey (the host country for this population). This research attempts to answer the question as to what the barriers/enablers are which policy makers should be aware of and which contribute to a successful eService system in countries suffering from different pressures. The results reveal emergent themes that impact eService delivery to refugees and displaced people, including: Political Situation, Citizen demand, Corruption, Poverty, Public Awareness, Digital divide, Connectivity, Social media, Mobile communications, Cloud computing, Leadership and Top Managements, Legislation and regulations, Staff Training and IT Skills, Allocating Fund for implementation, Integration (Interoperability), NGOs, Citizen Trust and security. This article argues that the implementation of eService in unstable societies is an area requiring more research particularly working towards sustainable strategies. This study uses Institutional Theory as a theoretical lens (Al- Busaidy, 2011) to understand the challenges of eService adoption in unstable societies. © The Authors, 2017.},

abstract={In decision making most approaches are taking into account objective criteria, however the subjective correlation among decision makers provided as preference utility is necessary to be presented to provide confidence preference additive among decision makers reducing ambiguity and produce better utility preferences measurement for subjective criteria among decision makers. Most models in Decision support systems are assuming criteria as independent. Therefore, these models are ranking alternatives based on objective data analysis. Also, different type of data (time series, linguistic values, interval data, etc.) imposes some difficulties to do decision making using classical multi criteria decision making models. Sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate or extract emotions from the content created by users has been developed including support vector machines, Bayesian networks, maximum entropy approaches and concept level analysis of natural language text, supported by combinations of common-sense reasoning. These approaches are mainly based on language text processing with sufficient documents, which is usually inlarge is not available. We think Subjectiveness is related to the contextual form of criteria. Uncertainty of some criteria in decision making is also considered as other important aspect These draw backs in decision making are major research challenges that are attracting wide attention, like on big data analysis for risk prediction, medical diagnosis and other applications that are in practice more subjective to user situation and its knowledge related context. Subjectivity would be examined based on correlations between different contextual structures that is reflecting the framework of personal context, for example in nearest neighbor based correlation analysis fashion. Some of the attributes incompleteness also may lead to affect the approximation accuracy. Attributes with preference-ordered domain relations properties become one aspect in ordering properties in rough approximations. The Virtual Doctor System (VDS) developed by my group is a system assisting human doctor who is practicing medical diagnosis in real situation and environment. The interoperability is represented by utilizing the medical diagnosis cases of medical doctor, represented in machine executable fashion based on human patient interaction with virtual avatar resembling a real doctor. VDS is practiced as a virtual avatar interacting with the human patient based on physical views and mental view analysis. In this talk I outline our VDS system and then discuss related issues in subjective decision making in medical domain. Using fuzzy reasoning techniques in VDS, it has been shown that it is possible to provide better precision in circumstances that is related to partial known data and uncertainty on the acquisition of medical symptoms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Current IaaS cloud providers typically adopt different underlying cloud infrastructures and are reluctant to provide consistent interfaces to facilitate cross-cloud interoperability. Such status quo significantly complicates inter-cloud virtual machine relocation and impedes the adoption of cloud services for more enterprises and individual users. In this paper, we propose vMocity, a middleware framework enabling VM relocation across heterogeneous IaaS clouds. vMocity extends the principles of cold migration and decouples VM's storage stack from their underlying virtualization platforms, which presents a homogeneous view of storage to cloud users. We deploy our prototype system across three representative commercial cloud platforms-Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and VMware vSphere-based private cloud. Compared to existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world work-loads, vMocity can significantly reduce the disruption time, up to 27 times shorter, of relocated services and boost the recovery time, up to 1.8 times faster, to pre-relocation performance level. Our results demonstrate that vMocity is efficient and convenient for relocating VMs across clouds, offering freedom of choice to customers when facing a market of IaaS clouds to align with business objectives (cost, performance, service availability, etc.) © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Any information system using encryption tends to have its own key management infrastructure. In practice, we find a separate key management systems dedicated to application encryption, or database encryption, or file encryption etc. This emergent needs to several key management systems and multiple cryptographic algorithms are resolved by the new Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP). This work specifies how the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) can be included in Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol in order to provide additional security features, flexibility, interoperability and authentication specially in distributed systems like Cloud Computing. Till now, authentication in TLS is limited to digital certificate and Kerberos. In this paper, we use the Key Management Interoperability Protocol to make an additional authentication option for TLS and we reduce handshake latency to 0-RTT for repeated handshakes and 1-RTT for full handshakes. We specify also the KMIP-TLS extension and its formal validation with AVISPA tool. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The IEEE Intercloud project aims to facilitate intercloud interoperability and portability. While topology elements and basic security and trust models had been developed during the last years, an adequate base protocol for the intercloud communication is still required. This protocol have to be extensible and should eliminate limitations of HTTP. This paper proposes a novel protocol that addresses the requirements of the P2302 standard to design a service framework that provides similar capabilities as HTTP-based SOAP or REST web services. In fact, the protocol proposed in this paper adopts the REST architectural style to XMPP. Furthermore, the protocol allows for advertising resource capabilities, discovering resources, and to perform actions on resources by its nature. This protocol has been implemented in the RWX4J framework and was evaluated regarding functionality, performance, and efficiency. The results presented in this paper show significant improvements compared to HTTP-based RESTful web services. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Today's competitive environment pushes technology into changing quickly, hence triggering organizations to be ready for such changes. Cloud computing is one of the popular evolving information technologies that seems to affect organizations in different ways, and on different levels. The academic as well as the professional literature focused on identifying the several promoters and inhibitors for adopting cloud solutions. However, the related work does not clearly identify how adopting such solutions affects the organization's IT governance, where implementing effective IT governance is required in order to survive in a competitive market. Therefore, the aim of this research paper is to study the effect of cloud solutions on organizations' IT governance. We first built this paper through an exhaustive literature review describing the various cloud computing promoters and inhibitors, along with the organizational transformations cited by several researchers. Then, in order to validate these transformations and the effects brought by the cloud, we conducted a set of twenty interviews with professionals (CIOs, CEOs, and project managers) from large organizations in France. Our findings endorse the most common elements found in the literature regarding the important considerations when adopting the cloud (security, reversibility, interoperability, etc.) New findings have also been highlighted in our data analysis, cloud computing seems to affect the technological and strategical aspects of IT governance, as well as the business transformation. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Virtualization is the nucleus of the cloud computing for providing its services on-demand. Cloud-based distributed systems are predominantly developed using virtualization technology. However, the requirement of significant resources and issues of interoperability and deployment make it less adoptable in the development of many types of distributed systems. Dockerization or Docker Container-based virtualization has been introduced in the last three years and gaining popularity in the software development community. Docker has recently introduced its distributed system development tool called Swarm, which extends the Docker Container-based system development process on multiple hosts in multiple clouds. Docker Swarm-based containerized distributed system is a brand new approach and needs to be compared with the virtualized distributed system. Therefore, this paper presents the simulation and evaluation of the development of a distributed system using virtualization and dockerization. This simulation is based on Docker Swarm, VirtualBox, Ubuntu, Mac OS X, nginx and redis. To simulate and evaluate the distributed system in the same environment, all Swarm Nodes and Virtual Machines are created using VirtualBox on the same Mac OS X host. For making this evaluation rational, almost similar system resources are allocated to both at the beginning. Subsequently, similar servers nginx and redis are installed on the Swarm Node and Virtual Machine. Finally, based on the experimental simulation results, it evaluates their required resources and operational overheads; thus, their performance and effectiveness for designing distributed systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is based on Virtual Machines (VM) or containers, which provide their own software execution environment that can be deployed by facilitating technologies on top of various physical hardware. The use of VMs or containers represents an efficient way to automatize the overall software engineering and operation life-cycle. Some of the benefits include elasticity and high scalability, which increases the utilization efficiency and decreases the operational costs. VMs or containers as software artifacts are created using provider-specific templates and are stored in proprietary or public repositories for further use. However, technology specific choices may reduce their portability, lead to a vendor lock-in, particularly when applications need to run in federated Clouds. In this paper we present the current state of development of the novel concept of a VM repository and operational environment for federated Clouds named ENTICE. The ENTICE environment has been designed to receive unmodified and functionally complete VM images from its users, and transparently tailor and optimise them for specific Cloud infrastructures with respect to their size, configuration, and geographical distribution, such that they are loaded, delivered, and executed faster and with improved QoS compared to their current behaviour. Furthermore, in this work a specific use case scenario for the ENTICE environment has been provided and the underlying novel technologies have been presented. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing has transformed the accessibility and usage of information technology resources, by offering them as services via the Internet. Cloud service provisioning spans across infrastructure, platform and software levels. The management of the services at these levels is based on monitoring. The analysis of monitoring data provides insight into Cloud operations in order to make informed decisions. Due to the emergence of numerous heterogenous Cloud platforms with proprietary APIs, service and monitoring data are being formatted using diverse and mostly incompatible data interchange formats. This results to interoperability issues and makes the analysis of monitoring data from multi-Cloud service deployments difficult to handle. The existing research efforts on data interchange formats have been mainly focused on general performance analyses. Little or no effort has been channelled towards a combination of multiple data interchange formats based on data type to achieve efficient serialisation that can facilitate interoperability in federated Clouds, and also reduce the size of data and bandwidth utilisation cost. This paper addresses these issues by presenting automated framework that is capable of automatically selecting the most suitable data interchange formats for achieving an efficient formatting and serialisation outcome. The goal of the framework is to enable robust and transparent communication within and between multiple Cloud deployments. Based on three use case scenarios, we evaluate the proposed framework to demonstrate its efficacy in formatting and serialising data. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Vendor lock-in is a major barrier to the adoption of cloud computing, due to the lack of standardization. Current solutions and efforts tackling the vendor lock-in problem are predominantly technology-oriented. Limited studies exist to analyse and highlight the complexity of vendor lock-in problem in the cloud environment. Consequently, most customers are unaware of proprietary standards which inhibit interoperability and portability of applications when taking services from vendors. This paper provides a critical analysis of the vendor lock-in problem, from a business perspective. A survey based on qualitative and quantitative approaches conducted in this study has identified the main risk factors that give rise to lock-in situations. The analysis of our survey of 114 participants shows that, as computing resources migrate from on-premise to the cloud, the vendor lock-in problem is exacerbated. Furthermore, the findings exemplify the importance of interoperability, portability and standards in cloud computing. A number of strategies are proposed on how to avoid and mitigate lock-in risks when migrating to cloud computing. The strategies relate to contracts, selection of vendors that support standardised formats and protocols regarding standard data structures and APIs, developing awareness of commonalities and dependencies among cloud-based solutions. We strongly believe that the implementation of these strategies has a great potential to reduce the risks of vendor lock-in. © 2016, Opara-Martins et al.},

abstract={In order to fully utilize all potential available network resources and make the interoperability of systems possible, we propose to integrate cloud computing and peer-to-peer (P2P) computing environments together. We utilize the mobile multi-agent technology to construct an effective hierarchical integration model named Cloud-P2P. As the original management mechanisms for traditional cloud computing and P2P computing systems are no longer applicable to Cloud-P2P, we propose a novel hybrid collaborative management ring based on mobile multi-agent in order to ensure the efficiency and success rate of task implementation in the Cloud-P2P environment. This mechanism needs to divide the system into core ring, cloud inner rings and several peer rings. In each ring, every node is in collaboration with its neighbor nodes with multi-agent, or uses mobile agent moving from node to node with string or parallel methods to monitor the statuses and performances of all nodes, in order to avoid problems of performance bottleneck and single point failure. This paper analyses the node conditions of cloud computing and P2P computing environments in-depth, then elaborates on Cloud-P2P and the hybrid collaborative management ring based on mobile multi-agent (HCMRMMA). After that, the construction method of the network ring topology for Cloud-P2P is introduced. Finally, experimental results and performance analysis of HCMRMMA are presented. © 2016, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The need for increased response rate, problem limited storage, accelerated processing and etc. the tendency toward creating a new generation of healthcare system architecture highlight the need for further focus on cloud-based solutions for transfer data and data processing challenges. Integrity and reliability of healthcare systems are of critical importance, as even the slightest error may put the patients’ lives in danger; therefore acquiring a behavioral model for these systems and developing the tools required to model their behaviors are of significant importance. The high-level designs may contain some flaws, therefor the system must be fully examined for different scenarios and conditions. This paper presents a software architecture for development of healthcare systems based on pervasive computing concepts, and then models the behavior of described system. A set of solutions are then proposed to improve the design’s qualitative characteristics including, availability, interoperability and performance. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The cloud computing paradigm has changed the way of managing identity. Domain based identity management systems are no more suitable. The alternative of a universal identifier globally handled by an all knowing identity provider proved its failure. The best opproach is to follow the cloud paradigm by offering an Identity as a Service layer. Many projects and standards were proposed to reach this goal but the lack of interoperability and the increasing number of digital identities have hampered the task. We propose in this work an Identity as a Service framework based on the Automated IDentity Finder (AIDF) system which associates one service provider or more with the suitable identity provider after user consent, thus enabling Single Sign On. Additional functionalities are claims transform between different standards and semantic mapping among heterogenous attributes in the same identity context. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={It is generally conceded that by embracing the cloud computing paradigm enterprises are able to boost their agility and productivity whilst realising significant cost savings. However, many enterprises are reluctant to adopt cloud services for supporting their critical operations due to security and privacy concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise a set of policies that infuse adequate security controls in cloud services. However, the heterogeneous nature of these services, together with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinders the formulation of an effective and interoperable set of policies that is suitable for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work proposes an approach to the construction of ontological templates for the semantic representation of policies. These templates are capable of capturing the knowledge that must be infused into a policy in order for it to adequately take into account the needs of the underlying domain of application in which it is to be enforced.

abstract={The immense network of interconnected objects, called the Internet of Things (IoT), will eventually become a reality thanks to the MP2P (Mobile Peer-to-Peer) nature of the upcoming 5G and it will have the potential of growing into a valuable asset and revolutionize a plethora of fields. Due to its omnipresent character, the IoT can be successfully deployed in the area of healthcare, allowing this way the efficient management of equipment in medical facilities, as well as the immediate and remote monitoring and treatment of patients. In addition to IoT, cloud computing can also be integrated in such systems, opening this way new doors for the field of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) by taking advantage of the benefits the cloud brings to the table when properly utilized. This chapter briefly presents IoT and cloud computing, as well as how their combination can affect the area of AAL. It also provides information on how cloud services can be used for remotely monitoring the physiological condition of a patient, along with how IoT can be used in gathering the desired data. Additionally, Electronic Health Records (EHR) are presented, followed by how wearable technology, used in AAL, can benefit from an IoT cloud system. Finally, challenges and issues that appear from the utilization of cloud-based IoT for AAL are presented, such as security and privacy requirements, the difficulties in handling the massive amount of data generated, as well as device interoperability issues. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The growth of smart device and cloud computing makes the environment in which various services can be provided anywhere and anytime, so the DRM technologies have to react to such changes. From this aspect, we previously proposed the architecture of DRM-as-a-Service that provides various functionalities of DRM as some services on the cloud environment, and we referred to it as the DRM Cloud. In this paper, we define a reference model of DRM Cloud to represent some DRM functions that are provided by the DRM Cloud, and several service scenarios are proposed on the DRM Cloud. Also we simulate the DRM Cloud on the testbed and then discuss some security issues and how to handle the interoperability in the DRM Cloud. We conclude that the DRM Cloud allows the content consumers to use many contents with various smart devices, also let the DRM developers and the content service providers reduce the costs of development and business. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Although big data centers and latest technologies have handled huge volumes of data but still the problem of integrating heterogeneous data on the cloud persists. This paper proposes a model for integrating heterogeneous data on the cloud focusing on the security of data at rest. The model is based on service oriented computing, as services are based on fundamental features of interoperability and loose coupling. The different layers of the proposed model deal with different aspects of data interpretation on cloud. The client layer provides interface to the client and works on basic request and response parameters. The service inventory layer comprises of different services working on integration and encryption of data and the cloud data layer holds the actual data in uniform format. The paper aims to provide a solution to the heterogeneous data integration problem on cloud and data security at rest. © 2016 IEEE.},

Nowadays, these devices have some connection mechanisms, but the goal is to go beyond the simple connectivity that permits only the reading of the measured value on a computer monitor, to move towards a more complex device integration that offers the possibility to stream device data directly into patient electronic records, to create a database for further statistical investigations and to integrate the information derived from multiple medical devices into a single display. In this paper, we propose a method to connect and integrate into a cloud-based infrastructure the bilirubinometer, which is a typical Neonatal Intensive Care Unit biomedical device that measures the amount of bilirubin in infants' blood, which is symptomatic of neonatal jaundice. After data extraction process from the instrument, the database is normalised according to a record format defined in XML language. Then, through Web Services of importation, data is transferred to the cloud database. It enables online sharing of encrypted healthcare data, reported in a standard language to allow a complete interoperability as well as a total security of shared data. Our proposed infrastructure allows the communication between different medical devices of a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and permits the automation of the process of device data collection, transmission, storage, processing and availability for medical staff. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The advancement in mobile technology and the introduction of cloud computing systems enable the use of educational materials on mobile devices for a location- and time-agnostic learning process. These educational materials are delivered in the form of data and compute-intensive multimedia-enabled learning objects. Given these constraints, the desired objective of mobile learning (m-learning) may not be achieved. Accordingly, a number of m-learning systems are being developed by the industry and academia to transform society into a pervasive educational institute. However, no guideline on the technical issues concerning the m-learning environment is available. In this study, we present a taxonomy of such technical issues that can impede the life cycle of multimedia-enabled m-learning applications. The taxonomy is devised based on the issues related to mobile device heterogeneity, network performance, content heterogeneity, content delivery, and user expectation. These issues are discussed, along with their causes and measures, to achieve solutions. Furthermore, we identify several trending areas through which the adaptability and acceptability of multimedia-enabled m-learning platforms can be increased. Finally, we discuss open challenges, such as low complexity encoding, data dependency, measurement and modeling, interoperability, and security as future research directions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={We identify requirements and then propose a multi-layer architecture for smart city platforms (SCPs) based on an infrastructure layer operating as a multi-tier computing cloud using software-defined infrastructure (SDI), a platform layer providing data dissemination, and a Business-Intelligence-as-a- Service (BIaaS) layer offering analytics services to support smart city applications through open APIs. The multitier cloud enables the end-to-end orchestration of resources from sensor/actuator to smart edge and to core massive datacenter. The SDI provides the necessary heterogeneous resources, including computing, storage, GPUS, programmable hardware, sensors and networking, that are all managed jointly within a single domain or across multiple domains through federation. The data dissemination services allow individuals, organizations, and public agencies to share real-time or historical data within a domain or across domains. The analytics services provide intelligence by acting on data in support of decision-making. Public and private application providers use these services to create smart city applications. We discuss our experience implementing and operating a Canadawide multitier SDI cloud and a Greater Toronto Area (GTA) platform for smart transportation, and we present extensions of these platforms to handle smart city applications across multiple domains. Throughout we describe how the proposed smart city platform supports extensibility and smartness, and how it has the desired attributes of replicability, scalability and interoperability. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The application of information and communications technology to support urban operational decision makers has received vast interest from industry and academia. This has helped to mature several fields of research within the smart city domain, such as the internet of things, cybernetics, and informatics. However, these fields of research remain siloed, which leads to a clear gap in the literature. The paper recognizes the mentioned gap manifesting in a new smart urban area in Wales, UK, and presents a platform which intends to demonstrate the benefits of exploiting the synergies between these fields of research. Following consultation with various stakeholders at the pilot site, the platform utilizes advanced sensing, analytics, interoperability, and visualization components to provide valuable human-machine interactions to facility managers in the district. Delivering this high value knowledge in a timely, engaging, and accessible manner through advanced decision support interfaces. The paper presents the platform's software architecture, before discussing the decision support interface, intelligent web services, and interoperability components in more detail. The solution's key contributions beyond existing internet of things platforms are the use of a 3D game engine, machine learning and optimization web services, and the integration across the knowledge value chain. This knowledge integration is achieved through semantic modelling of the buildings, urban environment, socio-technical systems, and smart devices in the district. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The capability to operate cloud-native applications can generate enormous business growth and value. But enterprise architects should be aware that cloud-native applications are vulnerable to vendor lock-in. We investigated cloud-native application design principles, public cloud service providers, and industrial cloud standards. All results indicate that most cloud service categories seem to foster vendor lock-in situations which might be especially problematic for enterprise architectures. This might sound disillusioning at first. However, we present a reference model for cloud-native applications that relies only on a small subset of well standardized IaaS services. The reference model can be used for codifying cloud technologies. It can guide technology identification, classification, adoption, research and development processes for cloud-native application and for vendor lock-in aware enterprise architecture engineering methodologies. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={"Internet Plus" represents a new form of society that provides vast platforms of reform, innovation, and development. With the gradually deepening integration of the Internet and traditional industries, the "Internet Plus" has prompted profound transformation and has generated obvious influence on many traditional industries, such as manufacturing, agriculture, finance, education, and logistics. In the big data era, the instrumental acquisition of geo-information expands from professional air-space-ground sensors, such as satellites, airplanes, and UAVs, to billions of non-dedicated sensors connected to the Internet of things. Ubiquitous geospatial data sensors with communication, navigation, positioning, photo/video imaging, and broadband data transmission functions are in development. Furthermore, millions of video cameras in cities can continuously provide images with PB and EB data size. These ubiquitous sensors can greatly enhance the data acquisition ability of geomatics. The application of geomatics is becoming increasingly pervasive, expanding from expert users to global public users. However, given the volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data, effectively extracting useful information from big data is difficult, thus resulting in situations of "massive data, missing information, and unavailable knowledge". The ultimate goal of geo-spatial information services is to deliver the right data, information, or knowledge to the right person in the right place at the right time. To provide global all-time, all-weather services to everyone, we should overcome the defects of existing geospatial information service systems, such as limitations of coverage area, slow response, and weaknesses of systematic interoperability. Therefore, we propose an "Internet Plus" space-based information service coupled with ground networks. In line with the principles of "one satellite with multiple functions, multi-satellite networking, and multiple network cooperation", a proposal for an integrated space-based information service system is presented. This space-based network with remote sensing, navigation, and communication functions can be seamlessly integrated with existing ground Internet and mobile networks. With the support of spatial-temporal big data, cloud computing, and intelligent terminals for space-based information services, all sectors of the national economy, industries, and the vast majority of public users will be provided with rapid, accurate, and intelligent positioning, navigation, timing, remote sensing, and communication services in real time. Considering the development condition of aerospace and information technologies, we describe a trilogy of an "Internet Plus" space-based information service system construction: web GIS in the primary stage, sensor web GIS in the intermediate stage, and smart sensor web GIS in the advanced stage. The key characteristics of the three stages are emphasized. Finally, the development prospects of the "Internet Plus" space-based information service system and its key technologies are discussed. © 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.},

As cloud computing evolves to accommodate future technologies, inter-cloud ecosystem is started to be required as a necessary architecture. Although there are some proposals presented to manage the inter-cloud but no one guarantee a lock-free, interoperable and federated ecosystem. Conducted research is biased and cloud provider's need base, pushing cloud market towards the interests of commercial dominators. To fill this gap, after surveying the maturity of open technologies and current state of adoption of the openness from cloud providers, this paper presents ICCM: Inter-Cloud Concern Model, a reference architecture to model the concerns of interoperable cloud ecosystem. The aim of this research is to formally describe the aspects to be considered to design a people-centric IT solution that put computing providers in a hard competition to fulfill client needs. © 2016 IEEE.},

But due to the inherent problems of mobile devices as limited data storage capacity, processing power and battery backup, users are unable to store large amount of data on these devices. To avoid these limitations, the concept of Mobile Cloud Computing introduced, in which main processing tasks and data are offloaded into the cloud for processing and storage so that resource intensive applications can also be executed and a large amount of data can be stored on resource constrained mobile devices. In this paper, we are describing the current trends used in cloud storage for resource constrained mobile devices and their different perspectives.

abstract={Future IT visions, including smart city, smart building, smart home, smart mobility, and Industry 4.0, are evolving on the foundations of the Internet of Things (IoT). As those systems cover a large number of networked entities, design concepts for developing IoT systems must be highly scalable. One approach to fulfilling this requirement is the architectural style of the web, known as representational state transfer (REST).Due to its strength in terms of scalability, interoperability, and efficiency, the application of REST has been adopted in further domains including service-oriented architectures and cloud computing.Consequently, REST is gaining traction as an approved concept for implementing IoT systems on a large scale. Security is another crucial requirement, since IoT applications share sensible information.This chapter introduces a generic authentication approach for RESTful IoT protocols, which consider scalability and resource-restrictiveness constraints stemming from the architectural style REST and IoT environments. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The strategy to provide Open Educational Resource Repository (OER) for sharing among e-Learning systems to support lifelong Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in Thailand was proposed. The framework integrates the Open Educational Resources system and MOOCs system by using an invented FedX extension for exchange resources between the repository systems. The proposed framework is designed for scalable cloud system. Since the framework is designed corresponding to the massive objective, the system operation and the concurrent access capability are evaluated to measure the efficiency of the designed framework. In this paper, the framework is installed to virtual machines on cloud system. We evaluate the system in point of accession capability and responding time factor. Three main functions including OER, MOOCs, and FedX extension are analyzed separately. Experimental results report that the framework can provide up to 750 concurrencies without any defect in the limited virtual machine resources. The FedX extension does not produce a bottleneck trouble on the interoperability framework in any case. In addition, resources can be exchanged among third-party OER repositories by an OAI-PMH harvesting tool. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing enables the on-demand delivery of resources for a multitude of services and gives the opportunity for small agile companies to compete with large industries. In the telco world, cloud computing is currently mostly used by mobile network operators (MNO) for hosting non-critical support services and selling cloud services such as applications and data storage. MNOs are investigating the use of cloud computing to deliver key telecommunication services in the access and core networks. Without this, MNOs lose the opportunities of both combining this with over-the-top (OTT) and value-added services to their fundamental service offerings and leveraging cost-effective commodity hardware. Being able to leverage cloud computing technology effectively for the telco world is the focus of mobile cloud networking (MCN). This paper presents the key results of MCN integrated project that includes its architecture advancements, prototype implementation, and evaluation. Results show the efficiency and the simplicity that a MNO can deploy and manage the complete service lifecycle of fully cloudified, composed services that combine OTT/IT-and mobile-network-based services running on commodity hardware. The extensive performance evaluation of MCN using two key proof-of-concept scenarios that compose together many services to deliver novel converged elastic, on-demand mobile-based but innovative OTT services proves the feasibility of such fully virtualized deployments. Results show that it is beneficial to extend cloud computing to telco usage and run fully cloudified mobile-network-based systems with clear advantages and new service opportunities for MNOs and end-users. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The cloud computing paradigm as originally conceived has reached a plateau of evolution, exposing several limitations that compromise the main features of the paradigm: resource contention, interruption of services, lack of interoperability in data representation, quality of service degradation, and others. Consequently, several new approaches to its use and optimization have been implemented to maintain continuity of technology. In this way, multiple clouds organizations have been formed with the objective of maximizing the use of cloud computing, in particular small- and medium-sized cloud providers who present difficulties to maintain all properties of the paradigm have mobilized themselves into organizations to maximize their revenues. Such organizations, formally called inter-clouds, have been gaining attention, where solutions like hybrid clouds, multi-clouds, and cloud federations are the main elements in the academic–scientific and industrial world. In particular, cloud federations are well behaved because organizations governed by a contract can be interesting and useful in many critical environments. However, there is a lack of works dedicated only to clouds federations. In addition, the existing works are not able to describe federations as unique inter-cloud entities to highlight specific properties and characteristics. In this paper, we present the desired functional and non-functional properties for cloud federations through the identification of the main architectures in the literature and we evaluate these architectures based on the described properties. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) adopts and extends the concept of cloud computing to make mass Manufacturing Resources and Capabilities (MR/Cs) more widely integrated and accessible to users through the Internet. However, a single manufacturing cloud (MC) has limited MR/Cs, due to both economic and technical constraints, and can only provide limited manufacturing services in terms of function, price, and reliability, etc. Using the aggregated MR/Cs or services of multiple MCs is a natural evolution, i.e., MCs can satisfy peak demands for MR/Cs through collaboration, while users can have a wider selection of services from multiple MCs. To address such requirements, we propose a hybrid framework for integrating multiple MCs. The key functional modules and the business models of the proposed framework are presented to guide future integration of MCs. The enabling technologies, such as semantic web and ontologies, intelligent agents, service-oriented architecture, and materials handling and logistics technologies are also discussed. A case study is given, showing the feasibility and rationality of the proposed approach. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.},

Especially the service model Platform as a Service facilitates the hosting of scalable applications in the cloud by providing managed and highly automated application environments. Although most offerings are conceptually comparable to each other, the interfaces for application deployment and management vary greatly between vendors. Despite providing similar functionalities, technically different workflows and commands provoke vendor lock-in and hinder portability as well as interoperability. To that end, we present a unified interface for application deployment and management among cloud platforms. We validate our proposal with a reference implementation targeting four leading cloud platforms.

abstract={Mobile cloud computing has dual benefits that includes cloud computing and mobile computing. In mobile cloud computing data storage and data processing take place outside the mobile device. As a result, there is a high chance of security attack. The security even becomes more critical when mobile phone is initiating the handoff during handover management process. Thus, the attacker may easily get access to our sensitive data. Due to this the malicious user may see or modify our data. In order to overcome this problem, we need to store our data in clouds in a secured manner. In this paper, we propose a secure and strong authentication (SSA) process that stores the key at different cloud servers. This process provides strong authentication. Greencloud is used to validate the process. The results confirm that our proposed SSL protects the mobile cloud computing from malicious activities. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is becoming increasingly popular. Information technology market leaders, e.g., Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, are extensively shifting toward cloud-based solutions. However, there is isolation in the cloud implementations provided by the cloud vendors. Limited interoperability can cause one user to adhere to a single cloud provider; thus, a required migration of an application or data from one cloud provider to another may necessitate a significant effort and/or full-cycle redevelopment to fit the new provider's standards and implementation. The ability to move from one cloud vendor to another would be a step toward advancing cloud computing interoperability and increasing customer trust. This study proposes a cloud broker solution to fill the interoperability gap between different software-as-a-service providers. The proposed cloud broker was implemented and tested on a real enterprise application dataset. The migration process was completed and it worked correctly, according to a specified mapping model. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={High security of cloud computing is one of the most challenges to be addressed before the novel pas-as-you-go business paradigm is widely applied over the internet. Trust brings a novel means to improve the security and enable interoperability of current heterogeneous independent cloud platforms. However, there is no special trust evaluation model for cloud computing environment. Hence, this paper presents a new trust model based on fuzzy mathematics in cloud computing environment according to success and failure interaction between cloud entities based on the properties and semantics of trust. To compute trust in cloud systems, an algorithm based on proposed model is given. Simulation results show that the proposed model has some identification and containment capability in synergies cheating, promotes interaction between entities, and improves the performance of the entire cloud environment. © 2015, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: No organization can succeed if customers are not taken into confidence. The organizations must listen to its customers and stakeholders and adapt to their changing needs and preferences in the modern business practices connected with e-commerce. Social Media, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud Computing collectively referred as SMAC, the new addition suggested by the paper is Internet of Thing that has found to have a strong impact in transforming the customer experience, thus renaming SMAC as SMACT. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The paper focuses on impact of SMACT in E-commerce market place. The paper also attempts to analyses the drivers of SMACT that are responsible for transforming customer experience. Further the paper studies the strategies associated with SMACT for development of E-Commerce. An in-depth literature review was carried out to study the SMAC and IOT effect on customer transformation. A structured questionnaire was developed for studying the adoption of SMACT technology for better e-commerce experience. Statistical software package, SPSS 20 was used to analyze the questionnaire. Findings: It was found that drivers like Security, reliability, Integration, discoverability and Interoperability are transforming the customer experience through SMACT adoption and organizations also are encouraging their customers to accept these technologies. Organizations are also developing specific business strategies for incorporating these technologies in their business models. Application\ Improvement: Internet of Things has found its footholds in modern technologies among customers and they are readily accepting them as a part of their lives. Social Media, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud Computing are, hence incomplete without incorporation of "Internet of Things". The paper hence proposes that the IOT should also be studied along with other SMAC technologies and be called as SMACT.},

abstract={In the beginning of the e-commerce era, retailers mostly adopted vertically integrated solutions to control the entire e-commerce value chain. However, they began to realize that to achieve agility, a better approach would be to focus on certain core capabilities and then create a partner ecosystem around them. From a technical point of view, this means it is advised to have a lightweight platform architecture with small core e-commerce functionality which can be extended by additional services from third party providers. In a typical e-commerce ecosystem with diverse information systems of network partners, integration and interoperability become critical factors to enable seamless coordination among the partners. Furthermore an increasing adoption of cloud computing technology could be observed resulting in more challenging integration scenarios involving cloud services. Thus, an e-commerce platform is required that suites the advanced needs for flexible and agile service integration. Therefore, this paper aims to present a reference architecture of a novel pluggable service platform for e-commerce. We investigate on currently available online shop platform solutions and integration platforms in the market. Based on the findings and motivated by literature on service-oriented design, we develop an architecture of a service-based pluggable platform for online retailers. This design is then instantiated by means of a prototype for an e-commerce returns handling scenario to demonstrate the feasibility of our architecture design. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Desktop cloud paradigm arises from combining cloud computing with volunteer computing systems in order to harvest the idle computational resources of volunteers' computers Students usually underuse university computer rooms. As a result, a desktop cloud can be seen as a form of high performance computing (HPC) at a low cost. When the capacity of a desktop cloud is insufficient to execute a HPC project, a new opportunity for collaborative work among universities appears, resulting in a federation of desktop cloud systems to create a significant amount of virtual resources from multiple providers on non-dedicated infrastructure. Even though cloud federation generates research activity today, neither interoperability among several implementations of cloud computing nor the federation of desktop clouds are resolved issues. Therefore, our initiative is related to gathering the existing and idle computer resources provided by the universities that take part to form a cloud federation on non-dedicated infrastructure. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that drive the adoption of cloud-based services and further understand the impact of this adoption on the organizational flexibility. This study presents information technology executive’s perspective and discovers new constructs of organizational flexibility that can be achieved due to the adoption of cloud-based services, which is the main contribution of this paper. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses in-depth interview approach. Total 21 Indian cases were studied by interacting with respondents having similar profiles (i.e. CIOs, CTOs, technology heads, and systems managers). Based on the literature review a semi-structured questionnaire was prepared and administered through in-depth interviews. Findings – Analysis of data reveals that cloud-based services provide relative advantage in terms of scalability, accessibility, and on-demand deployment of services within no time. Easy to use interface, experience, and expertise of the cloud service provider as well as support from top management plays important role in the cloud adoption decision. Further the study also identifies that no matter which model of cloud-based services (software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)) is used; cloud-based services’ adoption impacts organizational flexibility, which can be divided into four categories, namely, economic flexibility, process flexibility, performance flexibility, and market flexibility. Research limitations/implications – This is an exploratory study conducted through in-depth interviews hence the results can further be verified through a quantitative research. The study does not explore negative factors that may discourage adoption of cloud-based services. Though two factors vendor lock-in and security emerged as a concern very prominently in the in-depth interviews but this issue can further be explored in detail. Originality/value – This study bridge the gap in the research by identifying the factors that drive the adoption of cloud-based services in different forms (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS) as well exploring the impact of cloud adoption on the organizational flexibility in case of Indian organizations. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The adoption of Cloud Computing technologies by the organizations has profound consequences on the way software applications are developed and used. The migration to the Cloud may be accompanied by the revision of the business process, to integrate tasks over big data. In this way, existing workflow implementations may be extended with calls to operations in Hadoop or other tools. In this work, we define a framework to implement business process over heterogeneous technologies. Our framework is based on a novel workflow engine, called μBP-AM. Workflow execution in μBP-AM is performed by successively transforming the graph obtained from a workflow definition. μBP-AM has a formal semantics, which gives a precise definition of how the workflow is implemented. μBP-AM is at the core of an extensible framework capable of supporting not only Web service operations but also Hadoop operation calls (among others). The tool described here was conceived to increase reliability and to promote interoperability. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework, as well as some experimental results. Experiments using this prototype show that compositions run in μBP-AM using about the same resources as those run by using other tools. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Currently, one of the hottest topics in the Internet of Things (IoT) research domain regards the issue to overcome the heterogeneity of proprietary technologies and systems so as to enable the integration of applications and devices developed for different environments in a single interoperable framework. Towards this objective, virtualization is widely used to foster integration and creation of new services and applications. Similar benefits are expected by its application in the smart grid arena. The use of a virtualization middleware is expected to enrich the capabilities and opportunities related to the use of smart grid devices. In this paper, we propose key features for an interoperable, re-usable, elastic and secure smart grid architecture which is cloud-based and relies on REST APIs. To highlight the benefits, a practical case study is presented, where outlined functionalities are implemented in a cloud-based IoT platform. The advantages brought by the proposed middleware in terms of interoperability, re-usability, privacy and elasticity of the underlying infrastructure are discussed. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Media content in its digital form has been rapidly scaling up, resulting in popularity gain of cloud computing. Cloud computing makes it easy to manage the vastly increasing digital content. Moreover, additional features like, omnipresent access, further service creation, discovery of services, and resource management also play an important role in this regard. The forthcoming era is interoperability of multiple clouds, known as cloud federation or inter-cloud computing. With cloud federation, services would be provided through two or more clouds. Once matured and standardized, inter-cloud computing is supposed to provide services which would be more scalable, better managed, and efficient. Such tasks are provided through a middleware entity called cloud broker. A broker is responsible for reserving resources, managing them, discovering services according to customer's demands, Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiation, and match-making between the involved service provider and the customer. So far existing studies discuss brokerage in a narrow focused way. In the research outcome presented in this paper, we provide a holistic brokerage model to manage on-demand and advance service reservation, pricing, and reimbursement. A unique feature of this study is that we have considered dynamic management of customer's characteristics and historical record in evaluating the economics related factors. Additionally, a mechanism of incentive and penalties is provided, which helps in trust build-up for the customers and service providers, prevention of resource underutilization, and profit gain for the involved entities. For practical implications, the framework is modeled on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) On-Demand and Reserved Instances service pricing. For certain features required in the model, data was gathered from Google Cluster trace. © 1990-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In a cloud computing paradigm, energy efficient allocation of different virtualized ICT resources (servers, storage disks, and networks, and the like) is a complex problem due to the presence of heterogeneous application (e.g., content delivery networks, MapReduce, web applications, and the like) workloads having contentious allocation requirements in terms of ICT resource capacities (e.g., network bandwidth, processing speed, response time, etc.). Several recent papers have tried to address the issue of improving energy efficiency in allocating cloud resources to applications with varying degree of success. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no published literature on this subject that clearly articulates the research problem and provides research taxonomy for succinct classification of existing techniques. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to identify open challenges associated with energy efficient resource allocation. In this regard, the study, first, outlines the problem and existing hardware and software-based techniques available for this purpose. Furthermore, available techniques already presented in the literature are summarized based on the energy-efficient research dimension taxonomy. The advantages and disadvantages of the existing techniques are comprehensively analyzed against the proposed research dimension taxonomy namely: resource adaption policy, objective function, allocation method, allocation operation, and interoperability. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={During the last years, because of the evolution of Cloud applications and the attractive advantages given to consumers, many companies outsource their data and Information Technology (IT) system to the Cloud based technology. With the growth in the number of Cloud Service Providers, many enterprises and organizations can use and associate services from multiple providers. There may be many Internet protocols for service access standards that are used to ensure interoperability between users browser and Web server, such as Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Each service has its specific characteristics such as authentication and security requirements. Hence, Cloud providers attempt to lock customers into proprietary interfaces so consumers can find themselves at not expects inevitable vendor lock-in. Therefore, the focus of our paper is to propose a solution to this problem by using Cloud intermediate between Cloud providers and consumer in heterogeneous Cloud environments interfaces. This is to achieve benefits such as standardization and interoperability, minimizing lock-in of Cloud providers. To reach such benefits, we propose a Cloud SaaS based on two interfaces and an interne component. These interfaces are used in Cloud Consumer and Provider sides and therefore guarantee communication between Cloud Consumer and Provider using different Internet protocols for Web service access such as REST and SOAP. Our approach guarantees interoperability and standardization in heterogeneous Cloud based environments because in this case Cloud Consumer and Provider using REST interface can communicate easily with Cloud Provider and Consumer using SOAP interface. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Platform as a Service (PaaS) model of Cloud Computing is at an early stage of adoption in spite of its perceived benefits, especially in speeding up the development cycle of Cloud-aware applications. Wider adoption of this service model is impeded by multiple inhibitors, one of which is a lack of interoperability between proprietary services of public PaaS providers. The paper presents the state-of-the-art of PaaS interoperability initiatives from industry and academia. Although these initiatives evidence interest in solving the issue, they are focused either on system infrastructure services or on enabling application portability. PaaS service interoperability has not received much attention yet. Aim: The paper proposes a Semantic-Agent framework as an effective solution for spanning multiple public PaaSs and integrating differentiated application infrastructure services. The proposed interoperability framework will be independent of specific offerings and targeted at the needs of developers. Methodology: This PhD (of which the current study is a subset) encompasses three primary tasks. First, an OWL-S based ontology for semantic annotation of PaaS services will be designed. Second, a multi-agent mechanism will be devised to enable semantic matching and composition of services. Third, a proof-of-concept solution that is able to span multiple public PaaSs and establish service interoperability will be developed. Contribution: The two main contributions of this research are: i) establishing a comprehensive ontology for PaaS services supporting Cloud application development, and ii) devising a novel framework enabling their interoperability. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Background: New community-based arrangements and novel technologies can empower individuals to be active participants in their health maintenance, enabling people to control and self-regulate their health and wellness and make better health-and lifestyle-related decisions. Mobile sensing technology and health systems responsive to individual profiles combined with cloud computing can expand innovation for new types of interoperable services that are consumer-oriented and community-based. This could fuel a paradigm shift in the way health care can be, or should be, provided and received, while lessening the burden on exhausted health and social care systems. Objective: Our goal is to identify and discuss the main scientific and engineering challenges that need to be successfully addressed in delivering state-of-the-art, ubiquitous eHealth and mHealth services, including citizen-centered wellness management services, and reposition their role and potential within a broader context of diverse sociotechnical drivers, agents, and stakeholders. Methods: We review the state-of-the-art relevant to the development and implementation of eHealth and mHealth services in critical domains. We identify and discuss scientific, engineering, and implementation-related challenges that need to be overcome to move research, development, and the market forward. Results: Several important advances have been identified in the fields of systems for personalized health monitoring, such as smartphone platforms and intelligent ubiquitous services. Sensors embedded in smartphones and clothes are making the unobtrusive recognition of physical activity, behavior, and lifestyle possible, and thus the deployment of platforms for health assistance and citizen empowerment. Similarly, significant advances are observed in the domain of infrastructure supporting services. Still, many technical problems remain to be solved, combined with no less challenging issues related to security, privacy, trust, and organizational dynamics. Conclusions: Delivering innovative ubiquitous eHealth and mHealth services, including citizen-centered wellness and lifestyle management services, goes well beyond the development of technical solutions. For the large-scale information and communication technology-supported adoption of healthier lifestyles to take place, crucial innovations are needed in the process of making and deploying usable empowering end-user services that are trusted and user-acceptable. Such innovations require multidomain, multilevel, transdisciplinary work, grounded in theory but driven by citizens' and health care professionals' needs, expectations, and capabilities and matched by business ability to bring innovation to the market.},

abstract={In this work we introduce the EUBrazilCC federated cloud e-infrastructure based on Fogbow, a new middleware designed to support federation of IaaS cloud providers according to a novel approach. It is based on the provision of federation functionalities offered at a higher architectural level than current approaches by being deployed on top of the IaaS cloud orchestrators of each federation member. Fogbow is endowed with great flexibility due to the use of plugins that allow for the definition of precise interaction points between the federation middleware and the underlying cloud orchestrator. The resulting architecture, which relies on standards for conciliating different orchestrators' peculiarities, is thereby able to provide a common API to decouple federation functionalities from the orchestrator functionalities. Fogbow has been deployed to federate the private clouds of the members of the consortium of the EUBrazilCC project, and is also being used in an experimental federation that is part of the cloud initiative of the Brazilian National Research and Education Network (NREN) operator, as well as in an experimental deployment that aims at federating private clouds belonging to two large public companies in Brazil. © 2016 IEEE.},

That initiative pushes public sector organizations from Member States for preparing themselves in procuring secure, cost-effective, reliable and trustworthy cloud services. C4E has adopted the Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) instrument for involving not only public sector entities but also IT, Telcos, and SMEs in providing innovative cloud-based solutions that best fit public sector's needs. In this paper, after presenting a brief overview of C4E initiative and the current European scenario for public cloud services and cloud projects, we discuss the lessons learned on the relevance of achieving cross-border interoperability between public cloud computing services, deriving from our successful participation at the first PCP phase as tenderers. © 2016 IEEE.},

SOFT-IoT implements the "Fog Computing" concept introduced by CISCO for the Internet of Things, where part of data processing capacity and service delivery operations are processed locally in "small servers", i.e., close to where data is collected. SOFT-IoT deals with protocols to facilitate the local computing processing and rely in more complex operations running in virtual entities avoiding the traditional approach of centralized cloud computing solutions. In this way, SOFT-IoT enables interoperability of local ecosystems in the fog and also at the cloud level, where other data is stored, processed and complex operations are resolved. In other words, in SOFT-IoT the data processing and delivery of services occurs locally in order to overcome with current infrastructure limitations and data processing alleviating those demands for heavy computational resources that can occur in remote servers, i.e., geographically away from where data is generated. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We introduce a new paradigm, based on an extension of the Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), for the on-demand monitoring of the cloud resources provided to a user. We have extended the OCCI with two new sub-types of core entities: one to collect the measurements and the other to process them. The user can request instances of such entities to implement a monitoring infrastructure. The paradigm does not target a specific cloud model, and is therefore applicable to any kind of resource provided as a service. The specifications include only the minimum needed to describe a monitoring infrastructure, thus making this standard extension simple and easily adoptable. Despite its simplicity, the model is able to describe complex solutions, including private/public clouds, and covers both infrastructure and application monitoring. To highlight the impact of our proposal in practice, we have designed an engine that deploys a monitoring infrastructure using its OCCI-compliant descriptions. The design is implemented in a prototype that is available as open source. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cloud Computing technology offers new opportunities for outsourcing data, and outsourcing computation to individuals, start-up businesses, and corporations in health care. Although cloud computing paradigm provides interesting, and cost effective opportunities to the users, it is not mature, and using the cloud introduces new obstacles to users. For instance, vendor lock-in issue that causes a healthcare system rely on a cloud vendor infrastructure, and it does not allow the system to easily transit from one vendor to another. Cloud data privacy is another issue and data privacy could be violated due to outsourcing data to a cloud computing system, in particular for a healthcare system that archives and processes sensitive data. In this paper, we present a novel cloud computing platform based on a Service-Oriented cloud architecture. The proposed platform can be ran on the top of heterogeneous cloud computing systems that provides standard, dynamic and customizable services for eHealth systems. The proposed platform allows heterogeneous clouds provide a uniform service interface for eHealth systems that enable users to freely transfer their data and application from one vendor to another with minimal modifications. We implement the proposed platform for an eHealth system that maintains patients' data privacy in the cloud. We consider a data accessibility scenario with implementing two methods, AES and a light-weight data privacy method to protect patients' data privacy on the proposed platform. We assess the performance and the scalability of the implemented platform for a massive electronic medical record. The experimental results show that the proposed platform have not introduce additional overheads when we run data privacy protection methods on the proposed platform. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is an evolving technology as it offers significant benefits like pay only for what you use, scale the resources according to the needs and less in-house staff and resources. These benefits have resulted in tremendous increase in the number of applications and services hosted in the cloud which inturn has resulted in increase in the number of cloud providers in the market. Cloud service providers have a lot of heterogeneity in the resources they use. They have their own servers, different cloud infrastructures, API's and methods to access the cloud resources. Despite its benefits; lack of standards among service providers has caused a high level of vendor lock-in when a software developer tries to change its cloud provider. In this paper we give an overview on the ongoing and current trends in the area of cloud service portability and we also propose a new cloud portability platform. Our new platform is based on establishing feature models which offers the desired cloud portability. Our solution DSkyL uses feature models and domain model analysis to support development, customization and deployment of application components across multiple clouds. The main goal of our approach is to reduce the effort and time needed for porting applications across different clouds. This paper aims to give an overview on DSkyL.

abstract={The expanding use of cloud computing is driving a growth in the amount of data traffic carried by wide area networks (WANs). Software-defined networking (SDN) is potentially capable of handling this growth efficiently while offering new services. SDN makes networks more flexible, leading to more timely service implementation and more efficient network operation. Such timely service implementation should enhance network value. Although SDN has already been applied to networks within data centers, it has not yet been applied to WANs. This is because WANs support social infrastructure, which demands strict quality and functionality, among other requirements. However, the application of SDN to WANs would promote open-source platforms, which would help eliminate vendor lock-in and support market expansion through open innovation. This paper first describes the challenges inherent in the application of SDN to WANs, presents Fujitsu's SDN solution for WANs, and introduces Fujitsu's projects related to WAN control technology and its open-source initiatives.},

This is because resources and APIs are dynamically composed; they are highly heterogeneous in terms of their underlying communication technologies, protocols and data formats, and interoperability tools remain limited to enforcing standards-based approaches. In this paper, we propose model-based engineering methods to reduce the development effort towards ensuring that complex software systems interoperate with one another. Lightweight interoperability models can be specified in order to monitor and test the execution of running software so that interoperability problems can be quickly identified, and solutions put in place. A graphical model editor and testing tool are also presented to highlight how a visual model improves upon textual specifications. We show using case-studies from the FIWARE Future Internet Service domain that the software framework can support non-expert developers to address interoperability challenges. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Big Earth science data offer the scientific community today great opportunities. Many more studies at large scale, long term, and high resolution can now be conducted using the rich information collected by remote sensing satellites, ground-based sensor networks, and even social media input. However, the hundreds of terabytes of information collected and compiled on an hourly basis by NASA and other government agencies present a significant challenge for atmospheric scientists seeking to improve the understanding of the Earth atmospheric system. These challenges include effective discovery, organization, analysis, and visualization of large amounts of data. This paper reports the outcomes of an NSF-funded project that developed a geospatial cyberinfrastructure-the A2CI (Atmospheric Analysis Cyberinfrastructure)-to support atmospheric research. We first introduce the service-oriented system framework, then describe in detail the implementation of the data discovery module, data management module, data integration module, data analysis and visualization modules following the cloud-computing principles-Data as a Service, Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service. We demonstrate the graphic user interface by performing an analysis between Sea Surface Temperature and the intensity of tropical storms in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We expect this work to contribute to the technical advancement of cyberinfrastructure research as well as to the development of an online, collaborative scientific analysis system for atmospheric science. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Cloud computing provides users the ability to access shared, online computing resources. However, providers often offer their own proprietary applications, interfaces, APIs and infrastructures, resulting in a heterogeneous cloud environment. This heterogeneous environment makes it difficult for users to change cloud service providers; exploring capabilities to support the automated migration from one provider to another is an active, open research area. Many standards bodies (IEEE, NIST, DMTF and SNIA), industry (middleware) and academia have been pursuing approaches to reduce the impact of vendor lock-in by investigating the cloud migration problem at the level of the VM. However, the migration downtime, decoupling VM from underlying systems and security of live channels remain open issues. This paper focuses on analysing recently proposed live, cloud migration approaches for VMs at the infrastructure level in the cloud architecture. The analysis reveals issues with flexibility, performance, and security of the approaches, including additional loads to the CPU and disk I/O drivers of the physical machine where the VM initially resides. The next steps of this research are to develop and evaluate a new approach LibZam (Libya Zamzem) that will work towards addressing the identified limitations. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={In the current decade, computing turns towards smart, mobile and ambient devices. As a consequence, applications and services have to be aware in order to react to a highly dynamic context (available resources, environmental conditions, user needs, etc.) and adapt their structures and behaviors. In such context-aware environment (e.g. smart buildings) interoperability is highly recommended and especially for contexts where (i) connected entities in a particular space need to understand each other and (ii) an analysis module can be built based on exchanged data querying. In this paper, we propose an ontology model for smart building that allows monitoring smart entities and enables a rule based analysis. The proposed ontology model defines seven major reusable concepts that provide the basic infrastructure to build an ontology model for smart space environments. As each smart environment is distributed over different locations and may have many kinds of devices etc., we propose domain ontology for the smart building space and implement a prototype for this ontology model using Protégé 3.5 as an ontology editor and Pellet as a reasoning engine. Furthermore, we define smart rules using SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) and infer those rules by SQWRL (Semantic Query-Enhanced Web Rule Language) query language in order to analyze the context and generate alerts regarding abnormal behaviors. The proposed ontology model is illustrated in a smart building space where the analysis infers and detects alerting situations, in a wireless sensor network, based on monitoring data collected from sensors. © 2016 ACM.},

Though the benefits of cloud computing is very appealing, the level of cloud adoption is still low among SMEs. This research aims to identify the key enablers, barriers and other factors that influence cloud adoption among SMEs in Tamil Nadu by conducting empirical investigations. We have used TOE framework to identify and capture the factors that affect technology adoption. We highlight cost benefits of using cloud infrastructure, scalability and agility of cloud services as the key enablers of cloud adoption. Broadband availability, high bandwidth cost and vendor lock-in are the main barrier for cloud adoption. Compatibility to existing system, complexity of the migration process, top management support, government policies and competitor pressure are the major organizational factors affecting cloud adoption among SMEs in Tamil Nadu.

abstract={The majority of the IT world is currently shifting to cloud platforms, and this calls for a greater measure of security for clouds. The emphasis for security originates from the need to transfer data across or within clouds without a third party being able to access the transferred information. This data is encrypted and decrypted using keys and is managed by Key Lifecycle Managers (KLMs) which communicate using a standardized protocol. Thus, to provide end user flexibility which helps in choosing the most reliable KLM, it is essential for cloud platforms to provide support for a standardized protocol so as to allow integration with external Key Lifecycle Managers. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Successful deployment of Electronic Health Record helps improve patient safety and quality of care, but it has the prerequisite of interoperability between Health Information Exchange at different hospitals. The Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) developed by HL7 is a core document standard to ensure such interoperability, and propagation of this document format is critical for interoperability. Unfortunately, hospitals are reluctant to adopt interoperable HIS due to its deployment cost except for in a handful countries. A problem arises even when more hospitals start using the CDA document format because the data scattered in different documents are hard to manage. In this paper, we describe our CDA document generation and integration Open API service based on cloud computing, through which hospitals are enabled to conveniently generate CDA documents without having to purchase proprietary software. Our CDA document integration system integrates multiple CDA documents per patient into a single CDA document and physicians and patients can browse the clinical data in chronological order. Our system of CDA document generation and integration is based on cloud computing and the service is offered in Open API. Developers using different platforms thus can use our system to enhance interoperability. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, administrators and practitioners want to speed up task processes, as decision-making and application periods in business life have been decreasing. As a result of this demand, accessing data clusters outdoors is now a necessity. Space and time dependency for accessing data has been reduced with the help of information technologies. Recently, a new technology called cloud computing (CC) has been developed to store and share the data under an Internet infrastructure. From a traditional viewpoint, editing, analysing and sharing spatial data have been made by way of a geographical information system (GIS). When technology developers harmonised CC and GIS, a new technological era called spatial cloud computing (SCC) or cloud GIS emerged. SCC is an efficient tool that is used for refining GIS applications and also delivering a comprehensive service for local governments. CC presents new important research eras in terms of development of GIS technology. The aim of this work was to determine the technical and practical problems in the process of moving towards SCC in Turkey and to prepare ‘would-be’ solutions for local government organisations. Some interoperability models for integrating spatial datasets were developed and tested with sample datasets. © ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective: Develop a device-agnostic cloud platform to host diabetes device data and catalyze an ecosystem of software innovation for type 1 diabetes (T1D) management. Materials and Methods An interdisciplinary team decided to establish a nonprofit company, Tidepool, and build open-source software. Results: Through a user-centered design process, the authors created a software platform, the Tidepool Platform, to upload and host T1D device data in an integrated, device-agnostic fashion, as well as an application ("app"), Blip, to visualize the data. Tidepool's software utilizes the principles of modular components, modern web design including REST APIs and JavaScript, cloud computing, agile development methodology, and robust privacy and security. Discussion: By consolidating the currently scattered and siloed T1D device data ecosystem into one open platform, Tidepool can improve access to the data and enable new possibilities and efficiencies in T1D clinical care and research. The Tidepool Platform decouples diabetes apps from diabetes devices, allowing software developers to build innovative apps without requiring them to design a unique back-end (e.g., database and security) or unique ways of ingesting device data. It allows people with T1D to choose to use any preferred app regardless of which device(s) they use. Conclusion: The authors believe that the Tidepool Platform can solve two current problems in the T1D device landscape: 1) limited access to T1D device data and 2) poor interoperability of data from different devices. If proven effective, Tidepool's open source, cloud model for health data interoperability is applicable to other healthcare use cases. © The Author 2015.},

abstract={In the age of cloud computing, the amount of data and services available for researchers continues to grow. As data are easier to generate and services simpler to deploy, researchers continue to face insurmountable integration and interoperability challenges. A major ongoing issue across many fields regards the automated and real-time integration of data and services. Besides aggregating and processing disparate sources, we need an always up-to-date view of our heterogeneous and distributed datasets. Enabling realistic insights over acquired information requires that data are as fresh as possible. This perspective appears in opposition to traditional warehousing strategies, where data are manipulated regularly over large intervals. Our proposal introduces a reactive and event-driven framework to simplify and automate real-time data integration and interoperability. This platform, entitled i2x, streamlines the creation of customizable integration tasks connecting heterogeneous data sources with any kind of services. Integration is poll-based, with intelligent agents monitoring data sources, or push-based, where the platform waits for data submission by external resources. I2X delivers data to services through a comprehensive template engine, where the platform maps data from the original data source to the destination resources. I2X is an open-source framework available online at https://bioinformatics.ua.pt/i2x/. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The HLA framework is widely used to formalize simulations and achieve reusability and interoperability of simulation components. In order to manage the underlying system of HLA-based simulations, Grid Computing and Cloud Computing are employed to tackle the details of operation, configuration, and maintenance of simulation platforms that simulation applications run on. However, to make a simulation-run-ready environment among different types of computing resources and network environments is challenging, especially for modelers who may not be familiar with the management of distributed systems. In this article, we propose a new cloud-based scheme for HLA based simulations, aiming to ease the management of underlying resources, particularly for those located on geographically distributed locations, and to achieve rapid elasticity that can provide adequate computing capability to end users. An approach for handling diverse network environments is given, by adopting it, idle public resources can be easily configured as additional computing resources for the local cloud infrastructure. In the experiments, compared with its corresponding Grid Computing platform, this Cloud Computing platform achieves a similar performance but with many advantages that Cloud can provide, such as energy consumption, security, and multi-user availability. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The IEEE P2302 Intercloud WG conducts work since 2011 on the project Standard for Intercloud Interoperability and Federation with the goal to define a standard architecture and building components for large-scale interoperability of independent cloud providers. While the standardization process has achieved fine-grained definitions of several Intercloud components, a deployment of the Intercloud to demonstrate the architectural feasibility is not yet operational. In this paper, we describe a deployed community network cloud and we show how it matches in several aspects the vision of the Intercloud. Similar to the Intercloud, the community network cloud consists of many small cloud providers, which for interoperability use a set of common services. In this sense, the community network cloud is a real use case for elements that the Intercloud standardization WG envisions, and can feed back to and even become part of the Intercloud. In fact, a study on Small or Medium Enterprise (SME) provided commercial services in the community network cloud indicates the importance of the success of the Intercloud standardization initiative for SMEs. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) adopts and extends the concept of cloud computing to make mass Manufacturing Resources and Capabilities (MR/Cs) more widely integrated and accessible to users through the Internet. However, a single manufacturing cloud (MC) only has relatively limited scalability and elasticity. Using the aggregated MR/Cs from multiple MCs is a natural evolution. To address this requirement, we propose an integration framework for multiple MCs, so that MCs can collaboratively cope with peak user demands for MR/Cs. The key functional modules and the business model of the proposed framework are presented to guide future integration of multiple MCs. The enabling technologies, such as semantic web and ontologies, intelligent agents, service oriented architecture, and material handling and logistics technologies are also discussed. An application example is given, showing the feasibility and rationality of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) puts forward an interoperable architecture of home network equipment to implement the simple and seamless interoperability between household appliances, mobile devices and computers, so as to enhance and enrich users' experience. Because DLNA is designed to implement the sharing of multimedia resources between devices in a family environment, it does not support cross-LAN accessing. Currently, the cross-network cooperative work between smart devices has become a hot issue. To overcome this problem, this paper presents CLMRS - a cross-LAN accessing solution of C/S architecture based on DLNA technology. CLMRS can be used to implement cross-network media resources sharing by designing DLNA gateway/router of applicaion-level. We use DLNA gateway as a agent of LAN which is designed to transpond communication messages and to redirect address. To achieve cross-LAN media resources sharing, CLMRS adapts DLNA router as a transfer server to transpond communication data and to manage users access right. We also optimize the transmission path of media Steam to reduce the pressure of DLNA router. In order to protect user privacy, CLMRS sets a family account to limit the access right and proposes an efficient and secure authentication mechanism with anonymity. Our design and theoretical model are validated via implementing an instance of DLNA cross-network communication. Experimental results show that the approach is practical and can protect user privacy effectively. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is increasingly used as the platform for IT infrastructure provisioning, application/systems development and end user support of a wide range of core services and applications for businesses and organisations. Cloud Computing is drastically changing the way IT is delivered and used. However, many challenges remain to be tackled. Concerns such as security, vendor lock-in, interoperability and accessibility are examples of issues that need to be addressed. Standards and certification programs play an important role in terms of increasing the market confidence in Cloud Computing. The availability of Cloud Computing standards and certification schemes that address current concerns will ensure that both customers/users as well as providers are likely to regard Cloud Computing with the same level of reliability, trust and maturity as traditional IT. In February 2015, the Cloud Standards Coordination Phase 2 (CSC-2) was launched by ETSI to address issues left open after the initial Cloud Standards Coordination work was completed at the end of 2013. CSC-2 is investigating some specific aspects of the Cloud Computing Standardization landscape, in particular from the point of view of the Cloud Computing users (e.g., SMEs, Administrations). In this paper, we will present final results of the work. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The vendor lock-in has been a major problem since cloud computing has evolved as on the one hand side hinders a quick transition between cloud providers and at the other hand side hinders an application deployment over various clouds at the same time (cross-cloud deployment). While the rise of cross-cloud deployment tools has to some extend limited the impact of vendor lock-in and given more freedom to operators, the fact that applications now are spread out over more than one cloud platform tremendously complicates matters: Either the operator has to interact with the interfaces of various cloud providers or he has to apply custom management tools. This is particularly true when it comes to the task of auto-scaling an application and adapting it to load changes. This paper introduces a novel approach to monitoring and adaptation management that is able to flexibly gather various monitoring data from virtual machines distributed across cloud providers, to dynamically aggregate the data in the cheapest possible manner, and finally, to evaluate the processed data in order to adapt the application according to user-defined rules. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={A promising vision of distributed cloud computing is a unified world of multiple clouds, with business benefits at hand. In practice, lack of interoperability among clouds and management complexity raise many security and dependability concerns. The authors propose secure Supercloud computing as a new paradigm for security and dependability management of distributed clouds. Supercloud follows a user-centric and self-managed approach to avoid technology and vendor lock-ins. In Supercloud, users define U-Clouds, which are isolated sets of computation, data, and networking services run over both private and public clouds operated by multiple providers, with customized security requirements as well as self-management for reducing administration complexity. The article presents the Supercloud architecture with a focus on its security infrastructure. The authors illustrate through several use cases the practical applicability of the Supercloud paradigm. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={With the advent of Cloud Computing, new opportunities for Business Process Outsourcing services have emerged. Business Process as a Service (BPaaS), a new cloud service model, has recently gained a great importance for outsourcing cloud-based business processes constructed for multi-tenancy. In such a multi-tenant environment, using configurable business process models enables the sharing of a reference process among different tenants that can be customized according to specific needs. With a large choice of configurable process modeling languages, different providers may deliver configurable processes with common functionalities but different representations which makes the process discovery and configuration a manual tedious task. This in turn creates cloud silos and vendors lock-in with non-reusable configurable BPaaS models. Therefore, with the aim of enabling the interoperability between multiple BPaaS providers, we propose in this paper a semantic framework for BPaaS configurable models. Taking advantage of Semantic Web technologies and data mining techniques, our framework allows for (1) an ontology-based high level abstract representation of BPaaS configurable models enriched with configuration guidelines and (2) an automated approach for extracting the configuration guidelines from existing process repositories. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we extend Signavio with our semantic framework and conduct experiments on a dataset from SAP reference model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Cloud storage is a cheap and reliable solution for users to share data with their contacts. However, the lack of standardisation and migration tools makes it difficult for users to migrate to another Cloud Service Provider (CSP) without losing contacts, thus resulting in a vendor lock-in problem. In this work, we aim at providing a generic framework, named Portable Cloud, that is flexible enough to enable users to migrate seamlessly to a different CSP keeping all their data and contacts. To preserve privacy of users, the data in the portable cloud is concealed from the CSP by employing encryption techniques. Moreover, we introduce a migration agent that assists users in automatically finding a suitable CSP that can satisfy their needs.

abstract={Outsourcing enterprises’ data, business processes and applications to the Cloud is emerging as a major trend thanks to the Cloud offerings and features. Basically, enterprises expect when outsourcing to save cost, improve software and hardware performance and gain more flexibility by responding to the dynamic customers’ requirements. However, adopting the Cloud as an alternative environment for the management of the business processes leads to a radical change in the enterprise IT infrastructure. Furthermore, additional challenges may appear such as data security, vendor-lock-in and labor union rendering the outsourcing decision require a deep analysis and knowledge about the business processes context. Assisting enterprises’ experts in the business process outsourcing to the Cloud decision is the focus of this paper: it extends the BPMN 2.0 language to explicitly support the specification of outsourcing concepts, and it presents an automated approach to help decision makers identify those parts of their business process that benefit most from outsourcing to the Cloud. Using this extension helps also in identifying Cloud services considered as the most suitable to support the outsourced business process requirements. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Recent developments in Cloud computing technology provide capabilities for an extensible, reliable, effective and dynamic infrastructure to technology-enabled enterprises, in order to efficiently leverage (or even monetize) their on-premise equipment. Furthermore, the virtualization technologies powering the Cloud revolution expand their reach by the day, and are nowadays commonly available, nearly household, capabilities. In this light, the intersection between volunteering and Cloud computing may bring massive and ubiquitous compute power for IaaS users. For instance, scientists and researchers, as a category of very demanding users, may benefit from such an enlargement of the pool of resources to tap into for high complexity computational workloads and big data problems without concern for the setup and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure. We have investigated this concept in the past under the Cloud@Home project, aimed at implementing a desktop-powered Cloud. In this paper we propose a blueprint of a Cloud@Home implementation starting from OpenStack, a well-known platform for Cloud solutions, a de-facto standard with variety of features, high interoperability and Open Source support. The reference, layered architecture and the preliminary implementation of a Cloud@Home framework based on OpenStack are discussed in the paper. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Objectives: Presently, cloud computing is efficiently sharing data and resources over the internet. It is composed of five crucial characteristics such as On-Demand self-service, Resource Pooling, Broad network access, Rapid elasticity and Measured Service. With these characteristics cloud computing is introduced with some open issues like, Security, Availability, Scalability, and Interoperability. Traditional techniques cannot keep cloud computing secure fully. In cloud deployment and delivery models, mostly arrives the privacy and security issues. Hence, cloud computing security and its techniques are hot topic for researchers. Methods: To deal with the current security issues in IT market, industries are developing their architectural models with having strong level of security to their data center. Findings: In this paper, cloud security and privacy issues are analyzed and cloud deployment model security is explored. Moreover, service models of cloud computing are also described with its security issues. The observation from this study is to consider Audit as the important parameter in presenting security solution that covers maximum parameters of security, which are taken into consideration from literature. Application/Improvements: This paper studied about the cloud security concerns and brings a new challenge to the cloud service provider and a parameter wise comparison of existing security solutions. Based on these comparison a new security model is proposed which describes user's security requirements.},

In such dynamic and competitive market, working in silos is not a successful strategy. Therefore, single providers should integrate their resources and move up to a new level of cooperation and interconnection. This federation would bring in added value in terms of QoS, security, economics, etc. but also more complexity regarding federation management and how interoperability between disparate providers would be established.

abstract={Governments and healthcare providers are under increasing pressure to streamline their processes for efficiency, to reduce operational costs while improving service delivery and quality of care. Systematic performance management of healthcare processes is important in determining if quality of care goals are being met at all levels of the healthcare ecosystem. The challenge is that reaching these goals requires the aggregation and analysis of large amounts of data from various stakeholders in the healthcare industry. With the lack of interoperability between stakeholders in current healthcare compute and storage infrastructure as well as the volume of data involved, our ability to measure quality of care across the healthcare system is either limited or non-existent. Cloud computing is an emerging technology that can provide the needed interoperability and management of large volumes of data across the entire healthcare system. In this paper, we review various cloud computing applications for surveillance and performance management of quality of care in healthcare. We also introduce a framework for achieving systematic surveillance and performance management across the entire healthcare system. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Through the development and accessibility of the Internet, nowadays the cloud computing has become a very popular. This concept has the potential to change the use of information technologies. Cloud computing is the technology that provides infrastructure, platform or software as a service via the network to a huge number of remote users. The main benefit of cloud computing is the utilization of elastic resources and visualization. Two main properties are required from clouds by users: interoperability and privacy. This article focuses on interoperability. Nowadays it is difficult to migrate an application between clouds offered by different providers. The article deals with that problem in multicloud environment. Specifically, it focuses on the application performance optimization in a multicloud environment. A new method is suggested based on the state of the art. The method is divided into three parts: multicloud architecture, method of a horizontal scalability, and taxonomy for multicriteria optimization. The principles of the method were applied in a design of multicriteria optimization architecture, which we verified experimentally. The aim of our experiment is carried on a portal offering a platform according to the users' requirements.},

For these reasons, a new methodology with detailed steps to find and solve interoperability problems is proposed here. This new methodology is focused and implemented on the platform as a service model, but it can be used in any of the three main models of cloud computing. The methodology uses an iterative approach, because platform as a service offers and their application programming interfaces evolve and change very often. The focus of the methodology is to use remote cloud application programming interfaces to solve interoperability problems on technical, storage and services levels, respectively. Finally, we show the application of the methodology to achieve service-level interoperability among different providers of platform as a service.},

abstract={The emergence of complex cloud services and the growing number of QoS metrics entail the need of automation to transform business requirements into QoS constraints. Furthermore, in the emergent context of Cloud Federations providers need to share knowledge to improve interoperability when negotiating SLA (Service Level Agreements). Intelligent software agents are capable of supporting activities related to SLA negotiation, as well as sharing knowledge into large-scale distributed environments. Since they are usually provided with different ontologies, understanding the meaning of the messages requires the availability of common, global ontologies among customers and providers. In order to deal with this issue, we discuss a multi-agent SLA negotiation protocol which does not need a common global agent ontology. The protocol takes into account different concerns related to the understanding of semantic and technical terms, and the knowledge about the agent abilities on semantic and technical terms are shared among the Cloud Federation.

abstract={Cloud computing has been a massive trend over the recent years and eased the deployment of scalable distributed applications. While initially renting out virtual machines was the predominant form of cloud computing, nowadays Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions are emerging. The main advantages of the latter are a faster and easier application deployment as well as built-in support for horizontal scalability. However, when it comes to services with more demanding dependability requirements, currently provided deployment mechanisms quickly become insufficient, forcing cloud customers to fall back into manual, selfmade strategies. In this paper, we present BFT-Dep, a framework for deploying Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) services in a PaaS cloud automatically. BFT-Dep leverages the existing PaaS functionality to address specific deployment requirements and provides tailored support to set up and manage replicated services. It flexibly integrates BFT protocols as an independent service layer, thereby alleviating the complexity that the deployment of such systems entails. An initial prototype of BFT-Dep has been implemented on top of the open-source PaaS platform Open- Shift and a first evaluation shows its practicability. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.},

abstract={High availability and disaster recovery (HADR) are often discussed in highly critical business systems for business function recovery and continuity concerns. With the development of cloud computing, virtual cloud services are perfectly matched to HADR scenarios, and interoperability is a significant aspect to help users to use HADR service across different cloud platforms and providers. In this paper, we present an architectural pattern describing the integration of high availability and disaster recovery. We focus on database cluster replication between private cloud and public cloud environments. This HADR pattern for database cluster replication implements both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently for high availability and disaster recovery purposes. To evaluate the effectiveness of this pattern, we simulate a MySQL-database-cluster HADR scenario under three strategies: hot standby, warm standby and cold standby, and analyze the performance, business continuity features and cost. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Cloud computing has enabled various product lifecycle management (PLM) systems from different parts venders to form a heterogeneous system to facilitate joint product development. To avoid the performance issue caused by traversal multiple different PLM systems in hierarchical comparison, in this research we have developed an efficient hierarchical comparison mechanism for cloud-based heterogeneous PLM systems. We have used this mechanism to convert the traditional hierarchical comparison by traversal through the tree type data structure into a string comparison. Our approach is very simple but scalable, and also very suited to the cloud-based heterogeneous PLM system because the method itself is independent to the details of data stores. Therefore we have offered an efficient solution for a specific interoperability problem in cloud-based heterogeneous product lifecycle management systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

This paper proposes a process model transformation technique based on activity aggregation to efficiently distribute services for the Web of Data between various Cloud availability zones. The authors propose a workflow decomposition method based on SPQR fragments and the definition of an efficient service distribution algorithm according to a defined cost model. This cost model considers not only the transmission of information between activities for data and control scopes but also the cost of activity execution in different regions. Finally the authors validate their method by providing a tool that introduces the distribution information into the workflow, applying their distribution algorithm in a use case and describing the transformation process to distributed BPEL code that can be easily deployed to back-end instances.

The technical (TEK) team has developed a preliminary text template outlining requirements. Members of the MSG-136 TEK team are evaluating the applicability of several existing metadata specifications for capturing these requirements, including: • NATO Discovery Metadata Specification (NDMS) • NATO Core Metadata Specification (NCMS) • Modeling and Simulation Community of Interest Discovery Metadata Specification (MSC-DMS) • Federation Engineering Agreements Template (FEAT) • Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) • Swagger Preliminary analysis indicates existing schemas are insufficient to meet MSG-136's needs and the TEK metadata tiger team anticipates developing a new schema.

abstract={NATO and the nations use distributed simulation environments for various purposes, such as training, mission rehearsal and decision support in acquisition processes. Consequently, Modeling and Simulation (M&S) has become a critical technology for the coalition and its nations. Achieving interoperability between participating simulation systems and ensuring credibility of results currently requires often enormous effort with regards to time, personnel and budget. Recent technical developments in the area of cloud computing technology and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) may offer opportunities to better utilize M&S capabilities in order to satisfy NATO critical needs. A new concept that includes service orientation and the provision of M&S applications via the as-a-service model of cloud computing may enable composable simulation environments that can be deployed rapidly and on-demand. This new concept is known as M&S as a Service (MSaaS). NATO MSG-136 ("Modelling and Simulation as a Service - Rapid deployment of interoperable and credible simulation environments") is one of the working groups under the NATO MSG and investigates this new concept of MSaaS with the aim of providing the technical and organizational foundations for a future permanent service-based M&S ecosystem within NATO and partner nations. This paper presents the MSG-136 M&S as a Service (MSaaS) Reference Architecture that is currently developed as part of the technical concept. The aim of the MSaaS Reference Architecture is to provide a template solution for the development of concrete solution architectures for a simulation environment. The MSaaS Reference Architecture is based on the Open Group SOA Reference Architecture and uses the NATO C3 Classification Taxonomy as a tool for describing capability concepts and as repository for architecture building blocks and patterns. Two solution architectures designed from the reference architecture will briefly be described.},

abstract={One of the benefits of OCCI stems from simplifying the life of developers aiming to integrate multiple cloud managers. It provides them with a single protocol to abstract the differences between cloud service implementations used on sites run by different providers. This comes particularly handy in federated clouds, such as the EGI Federated Cloud Platform, which bring together providers who run different cloud management platforms on their sites: most notably OpenNebula, OpenStack, or Synnefo. Thanks to the wealth of approaches and tools now available to developers of virtual resource management solutions, different paths may be chosen, ranging from a small-scale use of an existing command line client or single-user graphical interface, to libraries ready for integration with large workload management frameworks and job submission portals relied on by large science communities across Europe. From lone wolves in the long-tail of science to virtual organizations counting thousands of users, OCCI simplifies their life through standardization, unification, and simplification. Hence cloud applications based on OCCI can focus on user specifications, saving cost and reaching a robust development life-cycle. To demonstrate this, the paper shows several EGI Federated Cloud experiences, demonstrating the possible approaches and design principles.

Currently, each cloud provider creates its proprietary application programming interfaces (APIs), which will complicate integration efforts for companies as they struggle to understand and manage these unique application interfaces in an interoperable way. This paper aims to address this challenge by providing recommendations to enterprises. The presented work is based on a quantitative study of 114 companies, which discuss current issues and future trends of integration and interoperability requirements for enterprise cloud application adoption and migration.

abstract={Cloud Computing enabled a lot of vendors to introduce various services. The diversity of provided services resulted in interoperability and portability issues. This paper discusses how semantic web and semantic web services can support the hybrid cloud model. It uses semantic web to provide a dynamic integration of in-house resources with the public resources, i.e. hybrid cloud. Different ontologies are proposed to describe the different scenarios of using the third party resources, i.e. infrastructure resources, services and composite services. A new framework, ShClS, is presented for that purpose. While the majority of the other works in the hybrid clouds concentrate on optimizing the cost and/or the response time, this paper proposes the usage of the risk of using resources in addition to the cost considering the privacy requirements of the owner. It depends on the expected monetary value analysis, EMV, when making the decision of running the job execution request using one of the different available integration options. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={With the pervasion of cloud computing, virtual enterprises (VEs) are anticipated to increasingly rely on ecosystems of highly distributed, task-oriented, and collaborative cloud services for their operations. In order to manage the complexity inherent in such ecosystems, VEs are expected to increasingly depend upon policies that regulate the deployment and delivery of these services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity inherent in cloud services hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable such policies. This calls for a policy validation mechanism that is able to automatically evaluate the correctness of these policies. This paper proposes such a validation mechanism, one which is underpinned by a generic representation of the knowledge that lurks behind policies and thus is orthogonal to any particular cloud service delivery platform. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.},

abstract={Cloud Computing providers offer diverse services and capabilities, which can be used by end-users to compose heterogeneous contexts of multiple cloud platforms to deploy their applications, in accordance with the best offered capabilities. However, this is an ideal scenario, since cloud platforms are being conducted in an isolated way by presenting interoperability and portability restrictions. Each provider defines its own API, non-functional requirements, QoS, add-ons, etc., and developers are often locked-in a concrete cloud environment, hampering the integration of heterogeneous provider services to achieve cross-deployment. This work presents an approach to deploy cross-cloud applications by using standardisation efforts of design, management and deployment of cloud applications. Specifically, using mechanisms specified by the TOSCA and CAMP standards, we propose a methodology to describe the topology and distribution of modules of a cloud application and to deploy the inter-connected modules over heterogeneous clouds. We present our prototype TOMAT, which supports the automatic distribution of cloud applications over multiple providers. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

This work approaches the concept of inter-cloud by utilizing APIs, open source specifications and exposed interfaces from cloud platforms such as OpenStack, OpenNebula and others. Despite other works in the area of inter-cloud, that are mainly resource management-centric, we focus on designing and developing a service-centric architecture. We implement an inter-cloud bridge system that is elastic, easy to be upgraded and managed. We develop a prototype composed not only from heterogeneous cloud platforms but also from independent cloud services. These are developed by different cloud service providers and offered as open source Software as a Service (SaaS). The proposed Inter-Cloud Mediation Service uses Future Internet SaaS such as a Context Broker for registrations and subscriptions to services and a Complex Event Processing engine for event management. We present an experimental analysis to show interactions with various heterogeneous cloud platforms and we evaluate the performance of inter-cloud services separately and as a whole. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.},

Proprietary vendor APIs make this challenging and lead to conditional code being written to accommodate various API differences, requiring application authors to deal with these complexities and to test their applications against each supported cloud. In this paper, we describe an open source Python library called CloudBridge that provides a simple, uniform, and extensible API for multiple clouds. The library defines a standard 'contract' that all supported providers must implement, and an extensive suite of conformance tests to ensure that any exposed behavior is uniform across cloud providers, thus allowing applications to confidently utilize any of the supported clouds without any cloud-specific code or testing.},

abstract={Today, IoT systems are designed and implemented to address specific challenges based on domain specific requirements, thus not taking into consideration issues of openness, scalability, interoperability and use-case independence. As a result, they are less principled, lacking standards, vendor oriented and hardly replicable since the same IoT architecture cannot be used in more than one use-cases. To address the fragmentation of existing IoT solutions, the IoT-A project proposes an architecture reference model that defines the principles and standards for generating IoT architectures and promoting the interoperation of IoT solutions. However, IoT-A addresses the architecture design problem, and does not focus on whether existing cloud platforms can offer the tools and services to support the implementation of IoT-A compliant IoT systems. In this work we propose an architecture based on IoT-A that focuses on the FIWARE open cloud platform that in turn provides the building blocks of future Internet applications and services. We further correlate FIWARE and IoT-A projects to identify the key features for FIWARE to support IoT-A compliant system implementations.

abstract={Healthcare using Mobile devices and Cloud Computing is an emergent topic of interest in both industry and research. Though ubiquity of mobile devices and availability of e-Health record plays an important role to enhance health care quality and services, it introduces several challenges too such as, limited power of mobile devices, privacy and anonymity of patient data, the reliability of end user, interoperability and availability of e-Health records, etc. Under HIPAA regulations, healthcare data needs to be secured from unsolicited disclosure when sharing among multiple medical service providers. In this paper, we focus on exchanging healthcare data among doctor and patient’s healthcare service providers. We develop an android mobile application and a Cloud service to exchange patient’s data among authorized users in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The cloud service that we developed performs cryptographic computations, communicates with mobile application and also overcomes the limitations of mobile devices. We evaluate our proposed solution using real-world data set. The performance analysis proves the efficiency of our application. Privacy analysis of our proposed solution depicts that our system is secure and protects the privacy of healthcare data. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2016.},

abstract={With the Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare and the related delegated decisions, the European Commission defined a legal framework on how healthcare shall be organised by European Union (EU) member states (MS) where patients can move beyond the borders of their home country. Among other aspects, Article 12 of the directive is concerned with supporting MS with the development of so called European Reference Networks (ERN), dedicated to the treatment of "patients with a medical condition requiring a particular concentration of expertise in medical domains where expertise is rare". In the "European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment" (ExPO-r-Net) project, the establishment of such an ERN in the domain of Paediatric Oncology is currently piloted. The present paper describes the high level use cases, the main requirements and a corresponding interoperability architecture capable to serve as the necessary IT platform to facilitate cross-border health data exchange. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Current solutions for establishing federations of clouds require applications to be installed on the individual members of the federation, which have to devote a certain amount of resources to services for federation managing. Moreover, additional interoperability requirements may need to be satisfied by individual clouds in order to join a federation. This situation may negatively affect the decision whether to join a federation. In this paper we propose an alternative approach by viewing creation and management of a cloud federation as cloud services themselves, thus allowing a drastic simplification in the federation set-up process and the decoupling of the federation management services from the technologies adopted by the individual clouds, minimising technological complexity and intrusiveness in the individual cloud infrastructures, while increasing the flexibility and scalability of resources. We also point out that existing technologies, in particular containers, microservices, configurators, clusters and orchestrators, can be the basis for implementing a platform for generation and management of federations of individual clouds, in a way which facilitates optimisation of workload and scaling of applications via resource aggregation, and makes deploying and joining federations fast, easy, and transparent. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.},

abstract={With the explosive growth of digital data communications in synergistic operating networks and cloud computing service, hyperconnected manufacturing collaboration systems face the challenges of extracting, processing, and analyzing data from multiple distributed web sources. Although semantic web technologies provide the solution to web data interoperability by storing the semantic web standard in relational databases for processing and analyzing of web-accessible heterogeneous digital data, web data storage and retrieval via the predefined schema of relational / SQL databases has become increasingly inefficient with the advent of big data. In response to this problem, the Hadoop Ecosystem System is being adopted to reduce the complexity of moving data to and from the big data cloud platform. This paper proposes a novel approach in a set of the Hadoop tools for information integration and interoperability across hyperconnected manufacturing collaboration systems. In the Hadoop approach, data is "Extracted" from the web sources, "Loaded" into a set of the NoSQL Hadoop Database (HBase) tables, and then "Transformed" and integrated into the desired format model with Hive's schema-on-read. A case study was conducted to illustrate that the Hadoop Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) approach for the syntax and semantics web data integration could be adopted across the global smartphone value chain.},

abstract={Decision-making in disaster management requires information gathering, sharing, and integration by means of collaboration on a global scale and across governments, industries, and communities. Large volume of heterogeneous data is available; however, current data management solutions offer few or no integration capabilities and limited potential for collaboration. Moreover, recent advances in NoSQL, cloud computing, and Big Data open the door for new solutions in disaster data management. This chapter presents a Knowledge as a Service (KaaS) framework for disaster cloud data management (Disaster-CDM), with the objectives of facilitating information gathering and sharing; storing large amounts of disaster-related data; and facilitating search and supporting interoperability and integration. In the Disaster-CDM approach NoSQL data stores provide storage reliability and scalability while service-oriented architecture achieves flexibility and extensibility. The contribution of Disaster-CDM is demonstrated by integration capabilities, on examples of full-text search and querying services. © 2016 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The proliferation of cloud computing has enabled powerful virtualization capabilities and outsourcing strategies. Suitably, a vast variety of cloud resource configuration and management tools have emerged to meet this needs, whereby DevOps are empowered to design end-to-end and automated cloud management tasks that span across a selection of best-of-breed tools. However, inherent heterogeneities among resource description models and management capabilities of such tools pose fundamental limitations when managing complex and dynamic cloud resources. In this paper we thus propose the notion of “Domainspecific Models” – a higher-level model-driven approach for describing elementary and federated cloud resources as reusable knowledge artifacts over existing tools. We also propose a pluggable architecture to translate these artifacts into lower-level resource descriptions and management rules. This paper describes concepts, techniques and a prototypical implementation. Experiments on real-world federated cloud resources display significant improvements in productivity. As well as notably enhanced usability achieved by our approach in comparison to traditional techniques. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

Convergence of contents, services, things and networks seems to be the cornerstone to fulfill these requirements.

The model is graph-based and composed by two control levels: a formal model and the instantiation level. An algorithm extracts a subgraph that identifies the applications to be executed according to changes in the external context.

abstract={This paper describes an information repository to support bridge monitoring applications on a cloud computing platform. Bridge monitoring, with instrumentation of sensors in particular, collects significant amount of data. In addition to sensor data, a wide variety of information such as bridge geometry, analysis model and sensor description need to be stored. Data management plays an important role to facilitate data utilization and data sharing. While bridge information modeling (BrIM) technologies and standards have been proposed and they provide a means to enable integration and facilitate interoperability, current BrIM standards support mostly the information about bridge geometry. In this study, we extend the BrIM schema to include analysis models and sensor information. Specifically, using the OpenBrIM standards as the base, we draw on CSI Bridge, a commercial software widely used for bridge analysis and design, and SensorML, a standard schema for sensor definition, to define the data entities necessary for bridge monitoring applications. NoSQL database systems are employed for data repository. Cloud service infrastructure is deployed to enhance scalability, flexibility and accessibility of the data management system. The data model and systems are tested using the bridge model and the sensor data collected at the Telegraph Road Bridge, Monroe, Michigan. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract={In order to attain the promises of the Cloud Computing paradigm, systems need to be able to transparently adapt to environment changes. Such behavior benefits from the ability to predict those changes in order to handle them seamlessly. In this paper, we present a mechanism to accurately predict the resource usage of distributed key-value datastores. Our mechanism requires offline training but, in contrast with other approaches, it is sufficient to run it only once per hardware configuration and subsequently use it for online prediction of database performance under any circumstance. The mechanism accurately estimates the database resource usage for any request distribution with an average accuracy of 94 %, only by knowing two parameters: (i) cache hit ratio; and (ii) incoming throughput.

abstract={Access Control is one of the essential and traditional security weapons of data protection. In open and complex environments such as the Internet or cloud computing, the decision to grant access to a resource must ensure a secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In recent years, many access control models and languages were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their specifications. In this paper we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies. Based on a semantic modeling approach, specifically formal ontology, we will try to incorporate data protection legislation requirements in policies specification and implementation. This aims to abstract the complexity of legal requirements expression and to facilitate their automation and enforcement at execution level. Indeed, at run time, the interoperability of diverse information and the reference to the text law are addressed in a novel manner. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016},

abstract={Sustainability is a global concern. It must be addressed by different sectors of society, even by the information technology sector. Moreover, such effort should not be only focused on direct impacts of technology over the environment, but also on the software engineering discipline by itself, which is facing now other dimensions of sustainability. In this paper, an adaptation of the Attribute-Driven Design method including sustainability as a driver is introduced. The proposal is based on sustainability guidelines established by the Karlskrona Manifesto. It involves a multidimensional sustainability analysis considering three levels of impacts and opportunities for each one of the architectural components. The adaptation is motivated by the design of a sustainable architecture of a cloud-based personal health record. The designed architecture is termed Health Catalogue Repository. It offers cloud services, allowing interoperability and timely access to patients’ clinical information. Energy consumption and resources optimization are contemplated like fundamental sustainability characteristics in the architectural design. The achieved design offers a better trade-off among quality attributes and sustainability constraints. The achieved design by using the proposal reduces the long-term impacts whilst increases the sustainability opportunities in architectural components. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={This paper introduces DEVS Distributed Modeling Framework (DEVS-DMF), a publicly available implementation of DEVS for integrating simulation models as parallel and distributed microservices suitable for containerization and automated deployment. Based on the Parallel DEVS framework, DEVS-DMF explicitly enables asynchronous execution of distributed models via the actor model of computation. It is optimized for interoperability of models and flexibility of deployment, as opposed to performance. The DEVS-DMF framework provides two simplifying benefits to the simulation developer. It encapsulates internal state and synchronizes simulation execution to free the developer to focus on designing the flow of messages and encoding the state transitions and outputs generated by their flow. It also provides a natural model for partitioning the simulation into local processes, because each DEVS model, as an actor, performs a unit of execution on a separate thread each time it handles a message. An additional advantage of this framework is location transparency, its flexibility to deploy actors in a single Java Virtual Machine to scale up, or to deploy actors to different containers in the cloud to scale out. Two simulation implementations of DEVS-DMF include a parallel simulation test case and a combat weapons simulator that assesses the performance of alternative small arms weapons designs. ©2016 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={Purpose - Web services play vital role in the development of emerging technologies such as Cloud computing and Internet of Things. Although, there is a close relationship among the discovery, selection and composition tasks of Web services, research community has treated these challenges at individual level rather to focus on them collectively for developing efficient solution, which is the purpose of this work. This paper aims to propose an approach to integrate the service discovery, selection and composition of Semantic Web services on runtime basis. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach defined as a quality of service (QoS)-aware approach is based on QoS model to perform discovery, selection and composition tasks at runtime to enhance the user satisfaction and quality guarantee by incorporating non-functional parameters such as response time and throughput with the Web services and user request. In this paper, the proposed approach is based on ontology for semantic description of Web services, which provides interoperability and automation in the Web services tasks. Findings - This work proposed an integrated framework of Web service discovery, selection and composition which supports end user to search, select and compose the Web services at runtime using semantic description and non-functional requirements. The proposed approach is evaluated by various data sets from the Web Service Challenge 2009 (WSC-2009) to show the efficiency of this work. A use case scenario of Healthcare Information System is implemented using proposed work to demonstrate the usability and requirement the proposed approach. Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper is to develop an integrated approach of Semantic Web services discovery, selection and composition by using the non-functional requirements. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Since its official introduction in 2012, the Robot Web Tools project has grown tremendously as an open-source community, enabling new levels of interoperability and portability across heterogeneous robot systems, devices, and front-end user interfaces. At the heart of Robot Web Tools is the rosbridge protocol as a general means for messaging ROS topics in a client-server paradigm suitable for wide area networks, and human-robot interaction at a global scale through modern web browsers. Building from rosbridge, this paper describes our efforts with Robot Web Tools to advance: 1) human-robot interaction through usable client and visualization libraries for more efficient development of front-end human-robot interfaces, and 2) cloud robotics through more efficient methods of transporting high-bandwidth topics (e.g., kinematic transforms, image streams, and point clouds). We further discuss the significant impact of Robot Web Tools through a diverse set of use cases that showcase the importance of a generic messaging protocol and front-end development systems for human-robot interaction. © 2015 IEEE.},

Nevertheless these approaches are difficult to adapt and deploy into the context of developing countries. That is the case of Colombia, which lacks of an integrated health system. In this paper, an architectural proposal for consolidating health records in the context of the Colombian health system is presented. To this end, a Health Catalogue Repository is introduced. It incorporates concepts such as community cloud, Health Record Banks, and Software as a Service architectures. The proposed Health Catalogue Repository is conceived to regulate the access, management, storage and secure sharing mechanisms of clinical data, by a patient self-management approach, whilst confidentiality is ensured. A set of Software as a Service, related to the Health Catalogue Repository is outlined and discussed.

abstract={The smart grid is concerned with energy efficiency and with the environment, being a countermeasure against the territory devastations that may originate by the fossil fuel mining industry feeding the conventional power grids. This paper deals with the integration between the electromobility and the urban power distribution network in a smart grid framework, i.e., a multi-stakeholder and multi-Internet ecosystem (Internet of Information, Internet of Energy, and Internet of Things) with edge computing capabilities supported by cloud-level services and with clean mapping between the logical and physical entities involved and their stakeholders. In particular, this paper presents some of the results obtained by us in several European projects that refer to the development of a traffic and power network co-simulation tool for electro mobility planning, platforms for recharging services, and communication and service management architectures supporting interoperability and other qualities required for the implementation of the smart grid framework. For each contribution, this paper describes the inter-disciplinary characteristics of the proposed approaches. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The incessant trend where software engineers need to redesign legacy systems adopting a service-centric engineering approach brings new challenges for software architects and developers. Today, engineering and deploying software as a service requires specific Internet protocols, middleware and languages that often complicate the interoperability of software at all levels. Moreover, cloud computing demands stringent quality requirements, such as security, scalability, and interoperability among others, to provide services and data across networks more efficiently. As software engineers must face the problem to redesign and redeploy systems as services, we explore in this paper the challenges found during the migration of an existing system to a cloud solution and based on a set of quality requirements that includes the vendor Lock-in factor. We also present a set of assessment activities and guidelines to support migration to the Cloud by adopting SOA and Cloud modeling standards and tools. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This chapter examines factors that influence individual adoption of cloud computing measured by the intentions to use cloud computing for personal needs. Drawing upon the cloud computing and online service literature, it recognizes eleven antecedents to individual intentions to use cloud computing. An empirical test on undergraduate and graduate students shows that of these antecedents a person's attitude toward cloud computing, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and perceived usefulness have direct impacts on intentions, while other antecedents, including perceived ease of use, transferability of computer skills, vendor reputation, perceived risks, privacy concerns, security concerns, and concerns about vendor lock-in, have indirect impacts. The study expands the view on cloud computing adoption among individual users with a multiplicity of factors and an integrative framework, and it also highlights the tradeoffs between benefits and risks in adoption decisions. © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={Traffic engineering is a key in effective utilisation of the road network infrastructure. Simulation assists traffic engineers making informed decisions on how to operate and direct traffic within the road networks. These simulations are complex, generate big data and require high-powered computers, which can process information faster than real time, to ensure the results can be used to affect traffic. Cloud computing, a relatively new technology paradigm, can meet the essential requirements, such as scalability, interoperability, availability and high-end performance. In this paper, a novel approach to a synchronisation strategy of large-scale complex simulations is proposed. This approach builds upon advancements achieved in distributed computing. The new synchronisation strategy is designed to allow different granularities of synchronisation accuracy. Through this strategy, synchronisation overhead is reduced, thus allowing the computing bandwidth to be applied to simulation performance increases as a result of the trade off between synchronisation accuracy and performance. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing has rapidly evolved and spread in the past few years, with always new services and functionalities being offered by providers in order to gain larger market sectors. This has caused in many cases a lot of distress and confusion to customers who have been often subjected to the 'vendor lock-in' phenomenon, because of interoperability and portability issues often arising among different Cloud providers. In this paper we provide a brief introduction to the basic definitions of Cloud Computing, portability and interoperability and we also describe a set of established use cases. All these notions are mapped to a multi-dimensional space, which is used to classify both definitions and use cases. The focus here is represented by portability and interoperability features. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The emerging field of Cloud Computing provides several advantages over traditional in-house IT services, such as accessing to elastic on-demand computing and storage over the Internet, and cost effective pay-per-use subscription plans. However, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), cloud computing has several issues, such as a lack of standardization, a lack of customization, and limited interoperability. In addition, there is an increasing demand for introduction and migration of a variety of services to cloud computing systems, which are abstract their offering services into various∗-as-a-Services (∗aaS) layers. Although each such service provides a new feature (e.g., simulation services in cloud), it aggravates the issues due to the lack of standardization and inability to customize services by a vendor because each∗aaS has its own features, requirements and output. In this paper, we propose a cloud architecture to alleviate issues associated with standardization and customization. In the cloud, the proposed architecture uses a single layer, called Template-as-a-Service (TaaS), to provide: (i) a single service layer for interaction with all resources and major cloud services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and∗aaS), (ii) a standardization for existing services and future∗aaS across different cloud environments, and (iii) a customizable architecture which can be modified on demand by a cloud vendor, and its partners to provide the flexibility on cloud computing systems. A comparison with previous studies show that the proposed architecture provides customization and standardization for cloud services with minimum modifications. © 2015 IEEE.},

However, the volume of data they generate is becoming difficult to store and process on local platforms. The scalability offered by Cloud computing provides a solution to this problem. Cloud computing provides resources at low cost for its users. However, platform-independent methods of gathering and transmitting sensor data to Clouds are not widely available. This paper presents a Cloud-based smart device data monitoring, gathering and processing platform. It first reviews the state-of-the-art embodied by the existing solutions and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. Informed by the survey analysis, a generic architecture is presented that addresses the identified challenges facing data gathering and processing in this area.

abstract={The concurrent popularity of wearable sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) brings significant benefits to body sensor networks (BSN) that could communicate with the cloud computing platforms for bringing interoperability in health and wellness monitoring. We designed Pulse-Glasses that are cloud-connected, wearable, smart eyeglasses for unobtrusive and continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring. We 3D-printed the first prototype of Pulse-Glasses that use a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor on one of the nose-pads to collect HR data. We integrated other circuits including an embedded board with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a rechargeable battery inside the two temples of Pulse-Glasses. We implemented IoT functionalities such that HR data are recorded from Pulse-Glasses, visualized on an Android smartphone, and stored seamlessly on the cloud. In this paper, we present the developments of Pulse-Glasses hardware including IoT services and the preliminary results from validation experiments. We compared Pulse-Glasses with a laboratory ECG system to cross-validate HR data collected during various activities-sitting, talking, and walking-performed by a participant. We used Pulse-Glasses to record HR data of a driver to test IoT functionalities of location services and BLE and cloud connectivity. The first set of results is promising and demonstrates the prospect of Pulse-Glasses in the field of cloud-connected BSN. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: In recent years data integration has become an everyday undertaking for life sciences researchers. Aggregating and processing data from disparate sources, whether through specific developed software or via manual processes, is a common task for scientists. However, the scope and usability of the majority of current integration tools fail to deal with the fast growing and highly dynamic nature of biomedical data. Results: In this work we introduce a reactive and event-driven framework that simplifies real-time data integration and interoperability. This platform facilitates otherwise difficult tasks, such as connecting heterogeneous services, indexing, linking and transferring data from distinct resources, or subscribing to notifications regarding the timeliness of dynamic data. For developers, the framework automates the deployment of integrative and interoperable bioinformatics applications, using atomic data storage for content change detection, and enabling agent-based intelligent extract, transform and load tasks. Conclusions: This work bridges the gap between the growing number of services, accessing specific data sources or algorithms, and the growing number of users, performing simple integration tasks on a recurring basis, through a streamlined workspace available to researchers and developers alike.

abstract={The gap between technology and learning methods has two important implications: on the one hand, we should not expect the integration of technological advances into teaching to be an easy task; and there is a danger that mature educational technologies and methods might not give an adequate answer to the demands and needs of society, underusing their transforming potential to improve learning processes. This study discusses the need for a new technological environment supporting learning services, and proposes the concept of the technological learning ecosystem as a solution to both problems. Educational ecosystems should be able to break the technological constraints of existing learning platforms and achieve an effective improvement in learning processes. Our proposed educational ecosystems pivot around five specific lines of action: 1) a framework architecture that supports learning servicebased ecosystems; 2) learning analytics for educational decision making; 3) adaptive knowledge systems; 4) gamification of learning processes; 5) semantic portfolios to collect evidence of learning.},

abstract={The approval rating of cloud computing as an emerging technology has been enhanced significantly and these days, there are many cloud storage and computing providers who offer their services regarding IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Despite these considerable benefits, there are serious concerns and challenges about this new technology. The most important issue is related to security and privacy subjects in cloud-based environments. Furthermore, resource allocation, load balancing, data management, data availability, scalability, compatibility and interoperability are the other challenges in cloud-based environments that decrease efficiency and reliability of this technology. In this paper, challenges and concerns related to cloud-based environments have been identified and most appropriate current solutions for each challenge have been described. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing has rapidly become the most effective computing paradigm for today's increasingly technology-dependent society. The emerging concepts of federated clouds with support for interoperability between different cloud providers and open standards in cloud middleware have opened up new challenges in cloud service management. One of the emerging research areas in cloud computing is the possibility of live virtual machine migration between different clouds. This is of importance when the quality of a cloud service currently used by a user degrades or a new cloud service is developed which is better in terms of quality, performance and cost than the current service being used. In such scenarios, the user needs to make a decision as to whether to continue with the currently used service or migrate to the newly available service. In our previous work, we presented a decision-making approach that assists a cloud service user in selecting a cloud service provider based on the QoS of its services. In this paper, we extend our previous work in the pre-interaction time phase and discuss the decision-making process involved in the migration from one cloud service to another cloud service through inter-cloud virtual machine migration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cloud and Grid computing share some essential driving ideas although the computing and economic models are very different. In this paper, we propose different strategies for the Batch-oriented and Service-oriented computing models interoperability. In particular, we describe an innovative approach to connect together Computational Grids and IaaS providers. This is achieved via introducing a simple and powerful DBMS-based system of deploying VM images from a Cloud environment in order to fulfill particular requests of task execution coming from a Grid environment. From a user point of view, resource authorization and access are kept unchanged, thus preserving the user experience related to the Grid. From the accounting point of view, in order to inform the Grid sites that a certain resource is available on a given Cloud-enabled Grid site, the information is published on the Grid information system. In this so-delineated scenario, we are able of using the powerful capability of distributing jobs of the Grid in order to allocate resources not only belonging to Grid clusters, but also with different architectures like GPUs, FPGAs and other systems. The target DBMS-based system has been designed for orchestrate a set of computing systems able to provide physical and virtual resources, creating a unified system, in which the various users-submitted computing tasks are managed and optimized. The goodness of the proposed system is demonstrated by a series of experiments highlighting the benefits of our approach. © 2017.},

abstract={A real challenge sits in front of the business solutions these days, in the context of the big amount of data generated by complex software applications: efficiently using the given limited resources to accomplish specific operations and tasks. Depending on the type of application dealing with, when trying to deliver a certain service in a specific time and with a limited budget, a sequential application may be redesigned in a convenient way so that it will become scalable and able to run on multiple resources. Many task computing model brings together loosely coupled applications, composed of many dependent/independent tasks, which will work together for a common result. When asking for a certain service, the most frequently constraints addressed by the user are deadline and budget. This paper elaborates on a multi-objective scheduling algorithm of many tasks in Hadoop for big data processing, named MOMTH. We consider objective functions related to users and resources in the same time with constraints like deadline (scheduling in due time) and budget. The algorithm evaluation was realized in scheduling load simulator, a tool integrated in Hadoop. MobiWay, a collaboration platform that expose interoperability between a large number of sensing mobile devices and a wide-range of mobility applications, was chosen for performance analysis of MOMTH. We compared the proposed algorithm with first in first out and fair schedulers and we obtained similar performance for our approach. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Scientists gain benefits from scalable resource provisioning on-demand, and various computing environments by using cloud computing resources for their applications. However, many cloud computing providers offer their cloud resources according to their own rules. The descriptions of various cloud resources also differ for each vendor. Subsequently, it becomes difficult to find suitable cloud resources given the characteristics of an application. Scientists therefore, select resources used in previous experiments or best performance resources without considering the characteristics of their applications. There is the need to standardize notations to support simple selection of cloud resources without the constraints of providers. Intercloud can use cloud resources without considering cloud providers in hybrid cloud environments. Intercloud project has been studied for interoperability and creates mOSAIC ontology to conceptualize various resources. However, the mOSAIC ontology attributes are limited when considering characteristics of an application. We propose a semantic engine to provide semantic cloud resource services in intercloud environment. We define a rule of categorized resource description with reference to mOSAIC ontology attributes which includes added factors needed to represent application characteristics. We also develop a semantic engine which can choose semantically similar cloud resources using statistical analysis while considering the characteristics of an application. The semantic engine can also classify resources dynamically according to application specifications. © 2015 IEICE.},

abstract={Today's applications are often constructed by bringing together functionality from multiple systems that utilize varied technologies (e.g. application programming interfaces, Web services, cloud computing, data mining) and alternative standards (e.g. XML, RDF, OWL, JSON, etc.) for communication. Most such applications achieve interoperability via the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), the de facto document standard for information exchange in domains such as library repositories, collaborative software development, health informatics, etc. The use of a common data format facilitates exchange and interoperability across heterogeneous systems, but challenges in the aspect of security arise (e.g. sharing policies, ownership, permissions, etc.). In such situations, one key security challenge is to integrate the local security (existing systems) into a global solution for the application being constructed and deployed. In this chapter, the authors present a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) security framework for XML, which utilizes extensions to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) policies that target XML schemas and instances for any application, and provides both the separation and reconciliation of local and global security policies across systems. To demonstrate the framework, they provide a case study in health care, using the XML standards Health Level Seven's (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and the Continuity of Care Record (CCR). These standards are utilized for the transportation of private and identifiable information between stakeholders (e.g. a hospital with an electronic health record, a clinic's electronic health record, a pharmacy system, etc.), requiring not only a high level of security but also compliance to legal entities. For this reason, it is not only necessary to secure private information, but for its application to be flexible enough so that updating security policies that affect millions of documents does not incur a large monetary or computational cost; such privacy could similarly involve large banks and credit card companies that have similar information to protect to deter identity theft. The authors demonstrate the security framework with two in-house developed applications: a mobile medication management application and a medication reconciliation application. They also detail future trends that present even more challenges in providing security at global and local levels for platforms such as Microsoft HealthVault, Harvard SMART, Open mHealth, and open electronic health record systems. These platforms utilize XML, equivalent information exchange document standards (e.g., JSON), or semantically augmented structures (e.g., RDF and OWL). Even though the primary use of these platforms is in healthcare, they present a clear picture of how diverse the information exchange process can be. As a result, they represent challenges that are domain independent, thus becoming concrete examples of future trends and issues that require a robust approach towards security. © 2016 by IGI Global.

In addition, the domain model reuse rate is very low in various application systems, and hardness to guarantee the consistency between designs and codes. Therefore, to resolve these problems, we need an approach aiming to automate the modeling and coding processes in e-assessment system. The present study describes an approach, based on service cloud computing, for integrating e-assessment functionalities of candidate LMS systems into a generalized e-assessment process. The proposed approach is based on three steps. The first step consists on development of generic e-assessment process based on reverse engineering. The second step describes a set mapping rules to adapt this generic e-assessment process on the learning profiles. To ensure more flexibility in the generated e-assessment process, we create a composite cloud service that's defining the mapping rules. The third step consists of defining the resulting e-assessment process as a composite cloud service allowing flexibility and interoperability between any LMS e-assessment. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Establishment of trust between Cloud consumers and service providers is a challenging issue, which is a major reason why organizations are reluctant to adopt the Cloud paradigm. In order to resolve this issue, various trust models have been proposed for the Cloud domain; however, none of these models are widely accepted by the industry because they only cover a few aspects of trust establishment, and do not support all the essential features. Several problems exist in the Cloud trust models, but lack of standardization and interoperability are the primary concerns. Similarly, there is no such generic and comprehensive trust model that can establish trust on all the layers of Cloud services, namely software, platform and infrastructure. Moreover, existing trust models have their limitations in terms of providing essential functionality and security features for trust evaluation. In order to provide reliable trust establishment in the Cloud environment, there is an indispensable need to carry out research and gather knowledge about the functional and non-functional features offered by the existing Cloud trust models. Comprehensive research about trust models would further help the Cloud consumers in the selection of an appropriate model, according to their security and functional requirements. In this paper, we have performed in-depth analysis of the existing trust models in the Cloud, considering the essential functional and non-functional aspects to accurately evaluate the trust of the Cloud providers. We present panoramic taxonomies covering state of the art features, which are considered critical for trust models to effectively establish and evaluate the trust between Cloud consumers and providers. Furthermore, we have applied the proposed taxonomies as assessment criteria for the analysis of various trust models in the Cloud domain. In order to effectively demonstrate the realization and use of proposed taxonomies in real life scenarios, we have presented an extensive case study about the Health Information Exchange System. © The British Computer Society 2014.

abstract={Cloud computing, featured by shared servers and location independent services, has been widely adopted by various businesses to increase computing efficiency, and reduce operational costs. Despite significant benefits and interests, enterprises have a hard time to decide whether or not to migrate thousands of servers into the cloud because of various reasons such as lack of holistic migration (planning) tools, concerns on data security and cloud vendor lock-in. In particular, cloud security has become the major concern for decision makers, due to the nature weakness of virtualization - the fact that the cloud allows multiple users to share resources through Internet-facing interfaces can be easily taken advantage of by hackers. Therefore, setting up a secure environment for resource migration becomes the top priority for both enterprises and cloud providers. To achieve the goal of security, security policies such as firewalls and access control have been widely adopted, leading to significant cost as additional resources need to employed. In this paper, we address the challenge of the security-aware virtual server migration, and propose a migration strategy that minimizes the migration cost while promising the security needs of enterprises. We prove that the proposed security-aware cost minimization problem is NP hard and our solution can achieve an approximate factor of2. We perform an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution under various settings. Our simulation results demonstrate that our approach can save 53%moving cost for a single enterprise case, and 66% for multiple enterprises case comparing to a random migration strategy. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Sensor technology and sensor networks have evolved so rapidly that they are now considered a core driver of the Internet of Things (IoT), however data analytics on IoT streams is still in its infancy. This paper introduces an approach to sensor data analytics by using the OpenIoT1 middleware; real time event processing and clustering algorithms have been used for this purpose. The OpenIoT platform has been extended to support stream processing and thus we demonstrate its flexibility in enabling real time on-demand application domain analytics. We use mobile crowd-sensed data, provided in real time from wearable sensors, to analyse and infer air quality conditions. This experimental evaluation has been implemented using the design principles and methods for IoT data interoperability specified by the OpenIoT project. We describe an event and clustering analytics server that acts as an interface for novel analytical IoT services. The approach presented in this paper also demonstrates how sensor data acquired from mobile devices can be integrated within IoT platforms to enable analytics on data streams. It can be regarded as a valuable tool to understand complex phenomena, e.g., air pollution dynamics and its impact on human health. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud concept is directly related with the beyond-ERP integrity and collaboration across a number of heterogeneous Supply Chain (SC) partner infrastructures. The technology enables partners to form a collaborative SC community without the burden of significant IT investment. Cloud applications offer significant opportunities from SC perspective, and the assimilation of the Cloud Technology is not complete yet in the Supply Chain domain. It also involves various barriers from implementation perspective, as well as the concerns related with vendor lock-in, security, reliability, privacy and data ownership. This chapter provides a comprehensive coverage of the opportunities and barriers as well as the generic treatment from SC perspective. It also highlights how the cloud technology represents a perfect fit with the ideas of 'Collaborative Supply Chains', 'Business Process Outsourcing' and 'long-term strategic partnerships, which are the key themes characterizing the Supply Chains of today's era. This chapter reveals that the intersection of the topics 'Cloud computing' and 'Supply Chain' is a promising area for further research. Further studies in a multi-partner setting with respect to a variety of configurations, case studies and applications, as well as the security, reliability and data ownership issues are justified. © 2015 by IGI Global.

abstract={The cloud computing paradigm enables the development of applications that can elastically react to changes in their environment by autonomously provisioning and releasing infrastructure resources. However, current applications need to be specifically tailored to a concrete cloud provider infrastructure, leading to vendor lock-in. Migrating applications to the cloud or between cloud providers is challenging due to differences in deployment directives, available services, and programming interfaces. Existing infrastructure as code approaches closely tie application artifacts to their deployment directives and do not allow for a clear separation of application artifacts from deployment infrastructure. In this paper, we present Smart Fabric, a methodology and accompanying toolset for infrastructure-agnostic deployment of application artifact topologies based on a constraint-based, declarative specification of the required deployment infrastructure. Our framework allows for seamless migration of application topologies between deployment targets and enables independent, parallel evolution of both, applications and underlying infrastructure. We discuss the feasibility of the proposed methodology and prototype implementation using representative applications from the Internet of Things and smart city domains. © 2015 IEEE.},

The architecture includes an open toolbox which provides tools as a service to support various phases of system engineering. The architecture uses the Open Services for Life-cycle Collaboration (OSLC) technology to create a reactive middleware that informs all stakeholders about any changes in the development artefacts. It facilitates the interoperability of tools and enables the workflow of tools to support complex engineering steps. Another component of the architecture is a shared repository of artefacts. All the artefacts generated during a system engineering process are stored in the repository, and can be accessed by relevant stakeholders. The shared repository also serves as a platform to support a protocol for formal model decomposition and group work on the decomposed models. Finally, the architecture includes components for ensuring the dependability of the system engineering process. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Porting applications to Clouds is one of the key challenges in software industry. The available approaches to perform this task are basically either services derived from alliances of major software vendors and Cloud providers focusing on their own products, or small platform providers focusing on the most popular software stacks. For migrating other types of software, the options are limited to Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions which require a lot of programming effort for adapting the software to a Cloud provider's API. Moreover, if it must be deployed in different providers, new integration procedures must be designed and implemented which could be a nightmare. This paper presents a solution for facilitating the migration of any application to the cloud, inferring the most suitable deployment model for the application and automatically deploying it in the available Cloud providers. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last years, the utilization of cloud resources has been steadily rising and an increasing number of enterprises are moving applications to the cloud. A leading trend is the adoption of Platform as a Service to support rapid application deployment. By providing a managed environment, cloud platforms take away a lot of complex configuration effort required to build scalable applications. However, application migrations to and between clouds cost development effort and open up new risks of vendor lock-in. This is problematic because frequent migrations may be necessary in the dynamic and fast changing cloud market. So far, the effort of application migration in PaaS environments and typical issues experienced in this task are hardly understood. To improve this situation, we present a cloud-to-cloud migration of a real-world application to seven representative cloud platforms. In this case study, we analyze the feasibility of the migrations in terms of portability and the effort of the migrations. We present a Docker-based deployment system that provides the ability of isolated and reproducible measurements of deployments to platform vendors, thus enabling the comparison of platforms for a particular application. Using this system, the study identifies key problems during migrations and quantifies these differences by distinctive metrics. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a novel cloud-based data storage solution framework named Data Vaporizer (DV). The proposed framework provides many unique features such as storing data over multiple clouds or storage zones, resistance against organized vendor attacks, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality through client-side processing, fault-tolerance against failure of one or more cloud storage locations and avoids vendor lock-in of data. Data Vaporizer is highly configurable to meet various client data encryption requirements, compliance to industry standards and fault tolerance constraints depending on the nature and sensitivity of the data. To enhance the level of security and reliability, especially to protect data against malicious attacks and secure key management in cloud, DV uses advanced techniques of secret sharing of the keys. The architecture and optimality of data placement and efficient key management algorithm of DV ensure that the solution is highly scalable. The data foot print and subsequent cost incurred by our storage solution is minimal, considering the benefits provided. The initial response for the adoption of DV in actual client scenarios is promising. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={While various platforms are offering facilities for single-cloud application design, deployment and provisioning, there is a need to move to multiple clouds in order to achieve cost-effectiveness and avoid vendor lock-in. Apart from not supporting multi-cloud application management, many platforms usually focus on the deployment and provisioning phases of the cloud-based application lifecycle by neglecting the design phase. However, the design selection of the best possible cloud service composition affects the provisioning phase, as the more distant from optimality is the selected solution, the more adaptation actions will be enacted. To this end, there is a high need for cloud application design tools and methods which can select the best possible cloud service composition based on user requirements. This paper satisfies this need by proposing a cloud service composition approach able to optimally compose different types of cloud services by simultaneously satisfying various types of user requirements. These types, not concurrently supported by any cloud application design tool, include quality, deployment, security, placement and cost requirements. Moreover, the proposed approach addresses a particular design choice type not currently considered in literature. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increasing adoption of Cloud Computing, Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) has recently emerged as the delivery of business process outsourcing services that are sourced from the cloud and constructed for multitenancy. BPaaS providers may look for available business processes from other cloud providers to improve their processes. However, today's BPaaS solutions lack an explicit and formal semantics which prevent an easy and dynamic interoperability between different cloud providers. In this paper, we propose firstly to semantically populate a shared knowledge base of process models deployed by BPaaS providers. Therefore, using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve similar process fragments that can be used to design new process variants. We also performed experiments on large public datasets and experimental results show that our approach is feasible and efficient. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The growing popularity of cloud computing has magnified the rise of software reuse by facilitating service provisioning over the Internet. At the same time, a new generation of mobile apps has emerged relying on backend services that expand the app functionally, while reducing the overhead on limited mobile resources. The Web service approach promises great flexibility in offering software functionality over the network, while maintaining interoperability between heterogeneous platforms. In addition, recent years have witnessed the rise of user-facing service developments that can be consumed on-the-go with a standard interface, such as Restful Web services. However, the discovery of such services does not match their growing popularity and remain challenging. Users cannot tolerate long latency in finding relevant services to their requests. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient Web service discovery approach that uses statistical methods and indexing techniques to improve the precision and response time of the discovery process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art discovery mechanisms and significantly reduces the query response time by at least 77%, while maintaining comparable accuracy. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Abstract The emerging market of public and private cloud infrastructure benefits the end users, as it reduces their costs, introduces new efficient services and provides variety of products. End-users primary deal with private clouds or brokers, which serve all the users needs, and if needed, buy extra capacity from public cloud. In this paper we study such a three-level market structure. Our goal is to find Nash equilibrium of prices in this market as well as market influence on the end users. We observe that new resources at public clouds positively affect the market from the end-user perspective. Additionally our observation indicates that the switching cost plays an important role in achieving the optimal point in average market price value, and thus reduction of the switching costs will benefit end-users even more. Thus the results imply that standardization of the interfaces and interoperability between various clouds increases market efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={It is increasingly being recognized that faster socioeconomic development in Africa is dependent upon the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Infrastructure for the dissemination of data and educational services. The scalability and flexibility provided by Cloud services in terms of resource management, service provisioning and virtualization makes it an attractive system for use with educational and ICT services. The flexibility of pay-as-you-go models combined with the ability to scale computing, storage and/or networking resources makes Cloud computing an ideal candidate for use with education, research and scientific infrastructures. Notwithstanding its benefits, transitioning from a traditional IT infrastructure to a Cloud computing paradigm raises security concerns with respect to data storage, data transmission and user privacy. This paper presents on-going research for the development of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) infrastructure for the distribution of Information Communication technologies (ICT) services in the African context. The Inter-Cloud Infrastructure Framework (ICIF) proposed, is conceived as a Cloud computing framework suitable for use with National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in the SADC region. The ICIF system is used to create an Inter-Cloud infrastructure, and helps NRENs transition from traditional IT infrastructure systems to the Cloud computing paradigm. It also provides new functional/operational components and Cloud services to support the interconnection and/or interoperability among SADC NRENs through the ICIF infrastructure. © 2015 IEEE.},

The main purpose is the creation of a scalable and flexible infrastructure for the exchange of scientific data from various application fields. The envisaged infrastructure is based on the cutting-edge technology of the Community Cloud Infrastructure for an aggregation and federation of resources, to optimize the use of hardware. The infrastructure is composed of: a central node, several nodes distributed in Italy, interconnection between other systems realized in Polar areas. This paper aims to investigate cloud solution, and explore the key factors which may influence cloud adoption in the project such as scalability, flexibility and expandability.

abstract={Abstract Cloud computing is increasing in usage because of its technical and financial advantages over traditional computing paradigms and also because of the availability of an expanding number of cloud services offered by new service providers. Consistent with its growth, there has been wide research interest in the literature that focuses on increasing cloud adoption. However, the current commercial and research-oriented cloud computing research in the literature mainly deals with functionalities closer to cloud infrastructure, such as improved performance and the management of virtualized resources, as well as fundamental issues related to efficient resource utilization, such as virtual machine (VM) migrations and server consolidation. While on the one hand, such features are very important, on the other hand, other important features, such as cloud quality of service management which is important for the cloud environment to move from a basic cloud service infrastructure to a broader cloud service ecosystem, have not received the required due attention. In cloud service management, a cloud service user has several choices for service selection and the quest to achieve interoperability and compatibility in cloud computing will consequently enable the user to easily migrate between service providers. In this scenario, the user needs to make important cloud service management decisions based on QoS, in addition to other criteria such as usage cost. These issues, when considered from a user's perspective, are quite different from cloud infrastructure management issues envisioned from a cloud provider's perspective. There are several challenges in cloud service management from a user's perspective, which the current cloud service management platforms in the literature do not address. To address this drawback, this paper presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art discussion on the existing approaches to cloud service management, critically evaluates them against the factors required for the user to manage the cloud service and presents a framework that assists the cloud service user in making cloud service management decisions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

POEM provides the following salient features: (a) it considers resource management not only between mobile devices and clouds, but also among mobile devices; (b) it utilizes the entire mobile cloud system as the mobile application running platform, and as a result, the mobile cloud application development is significantly simplified and enriched; and (c) it addresses the interoperability issues among mobile devices and cloud resource providers to allow mobile cloud applications running cross various cloud virtual machines and mobile devices. The proposed POEM solution is demonstrated by using OSGi and XMPP techniques. Our performance evaluations demonstrate that POEM provides a true elastic application running environment for mobile cloud computing. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={With the expansion of the Web, the desire toward global cooperation in the distributed simulation technology has also been on the rise. However, since current distributed simulation interoperability methods are coupled with system implementations, they place constraints on enhancing interoperability and synchronization algorithms. To enhance simulation interoperability on the Web, we implemented the RISE (RESTful Interoperability Simulation Environment) middleware, the first existing simulation middleware to be based on RESTful Web-services (WS). RISE is a general middleware that serves as a container to hold different simulation environments without being specific to a certain environment. RISE can hold heterogeneous simulations, and it exposes them as services via the Web. One of such services is called Distributed CD++ (DCD++) simulation system, an extension of the CD++ core engine that allows executing DEVS and Cell-DEVS models. Here, we introduce a proof-of-concept design and implementation of DCD++ using the distributed simulation using the RISE environment. We show how the RESTful WS interoperability style in RISE has improved the design, implementation and the performance of the DCD++ simulator. We also discuss a substantial performance improvement of the implementation of the RISE-based DCD++ presented here, showing many advantages of the RESTful WS presented here: improved interoperability, a seamless method to be connected into a cloud computing environment, and performance improvement when compared to our SOAP-based DCD++ in a similar testing environment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Cloud computing offers a compelling vision of computation, enabling an unprecedented level of data distribution and sharing. Beyond improving the computing infrastructure, cloud computing enables a higher level of interoperability between information systems, simplifying tasks such as sharing documents between coworkers or enabling collaboration between an organization and its suppliers. While these abilities may result in significant benefits to users and organizations, they also present privacy challenges due to unwanted exposure of sensitive information. As information-sharing processes in cloud computing are complex and domain specific, configuring these processes can be an overwhelming and burdensome task for users. This article investigates the feasibility of configuring sharing processes through a small and representative set of canonical configuration options. For this purpose, we present a generic method, named SCON-UP (Simplified CON-figuration of User Preferences). SCON-UP simplifies configuration interfaces by using a clustering algorithm that analyzes a massive set of sharing preferences and condenses them into a small number of discrete disclosure levels. Thus, the user is provided with a usable configuration model while guaranteeing adequate privacy control.We describe the algorithm and empirically evaluate our model using data collected in two user studies (n = 121 and n = 352). Our results show that when provided with three canonical configuration options, on average, 82% of the population can be covered by at least one option. We exemplify the feasibility of discretizing sharing levels and discuss the tradeoff between coverage and simplicity in discrete configuration options. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Cloud computing is the fastest growing, popular and most widely used technology in the current web. Interoperability is one of the major issues found in cloud environments where it is not an easy go for the cloud consumers to have a direct interaction with the cloud providers in order to request for a service. The semantic web technology is the most powerful growing technology to the current web which allows adding semantic metadata to the cloud services. Addition of Semantic web technologies to the cloud platforms provides scalable and efficient results to the consumers. This paper presents a semantic interoperability model which provides an improved interaction between the cloud Platform as a service provider and the cloud consumers. The semantic interoperability layer that sits between the cloud provider and the user does the semantic description generation of the service which helps in discovering the service and invoking the service with respect to the user’s request. This proposed method is done with the cloud service called Google app engine which is Platform as a service provided by Google and the semantic web technology tool used is JRDF, a framework for RDF and SPARQL Query language. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

In order to improve traffic safety and provide computational services to road users, a new cloud computing model called VANET-Cloud applied to vehicular ad hoc networks is proposed.

abstract={Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds couple applications tightly with the underlying infrastructures and services. This vendor lock-in problem forces users to apply ad-hoc deployment strategies in order to tolerate cloud failures, and limits the ability of doing virtual machine (VM) migration and resource scaling across different clouds. This paper presents the Supercloud, a cloud service comprising resources obtained from several diverse IaaS cloud providers, and discusses opportunities, limitations, and future research directions. Currently, the Supercloud has been deployed using resources from several major cloud providers, including Amazon EC2, Rackspace, HP Cloud, and some private clouds. VMs run in a virtual network and can be migrated seamlessly across different clouds, with different hypervisors and device models. Using case studies we demonstrate that, being able to deploy applications to more regions and granting more control to end-users, the Supercloud can reduce latency and cost compared to the underlying cloud providers.},

abstract={The popularity of the modeling and simulation application increases the demand for acquiring the service of the simulation resource and capability (R/C) anytime, anywhere, on demand through the network. Cloud simulation draws the idea of cloud computing that integrates and shares the R/Cs to provide services which significantly depending on the R/Cs' management. Most existing work assumes that there is only one management center, and some existing work uses master-slave management architecture. Both of them cannot provide services reliably in the wide area network. The relevant work in cloud computing deploys data centers scatted and executes the distributed scheduling reliably. However, it does not take the limited R/C constraint and the parallel interoperability of the sub-tasks into account which are unique in simulation field. Our goal is to re-design an architecture of R/Cs' management with multi-centers in wide area. We also propose a mathematical model for the cross-centric global optimized allocation of R/C services. The model includes the factors of the availability of R/C service and the remote collaborative cost among sub-tasks. We show the model achieves desirable effect in the utilization balance of R/Cs and the reduction of the collaborative cost by experiment compared with an existing decentralized model. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for organizations to adopt IT services at a reduced cost with increased reliability and scalability. However organizations are slow in adopting the cloud model due to the prevalent vendor lock-in issue and challenges associated with it. While the existing cloud solutions for public and private companies are vendor locked-in by design, their existence is subject to limited possibility to interoperate with other cloud systems. In this paper we have presented a critical review of pertinent business, technical and legal issues associated with vendor lock-in, and how it impacts on the widespread adoption of cloud computing. The paper attempts to reflect on the issues associated with interoperability and portability, but with a focus on vendor lock-in. Moreover, the paper demonstrates the importance of interoperability, portability and standards applicable to cloud computing environments along with highlighting other corporate concerns due to the lock-in problem. The outcome of this paper provides a foundation for future analysis and review regarding the impact of vendor neutrality for corporate cloud computing application and services. © 2014 Infonomics Society.},

abstract={Cloud computing is an efficient and cost effective realization of the utility function principle. Over the last years, a vast pool of choices for businesses has been created. This diversity of cloud infrastructures, platforms, and tools creates several challenges. In particular, it hinders interoperability, promotes vendor lock-in, but more importantly prevents businesses from making informed and optimal decisions when transitioning to the cloud. This paper presents the results of a business-oriented evaluation for cloud computing in the industry in Cyprus. The evaluation confirms that a set of key features is important for overcoming the above challenges and enables businesses to exploit the full potential of the cloud. Finally, PaaSage, a platform for autonomic multi-cloud deployment addressing these key features, is shortly presented. © 2015 IEEE.},

Mobile devices also benefit from cloud services. The huge amount of data that users produce with these devices is continuously posted to online services, which require the use of several cloud providers at the same time to efficiently store these data. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a way to improve social networking by interdisciplinary efforts that can be effectively supported by cloud computing solutions. This article proposes an approach for composing and interoperating cloud solutions to support IoT functionality. The author unites separate personal clouds in an autonomous way to cope with the enormous amount of data users produce and share in social networks.

abstract={Cloud technology has provided much more effective and flexible management of computing infrastructure both to service vendors and customers. However, the provisioning of computing resources and deployment of applications using heterogeneous infrastructure as a service (IaaS) clouds is not straight forward, because offers are not easily comparable, providers ask for using different technologies and a standard is still lacking. Moreover cloud providers often hinder the adoption of a common standard in order to lock customers to their solutions. To address these issues we have designed and developed, within the research activities of the mOSAIC project, an agents-based solution that provides a uniform interface to IaaS provisioning and management. The Cloud Agency uses a set of vendor agents implementing adapters to different commercial cloud providers and open source cloud technologies. Starting from the computational constraints and from the application requirements, the vendor agents allow the users to negotiate the best IaaS solution that is available in the cloud market and to build and deploy his/her cloud infrastructure.

abstract={Inter-cloud is an approach that facilitates scalable resource provisioning across multiple cloud infrastructures. In this paper, we focus on the performance optimization of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) using the meta-scheduling paradigm to achieve an improved job scheduling across multiple clouds. We propose a novel inter-cloud job scheduling framework and implement policies to optimize performance of participating clouds. The framework, named as Inter-Cloud Meta-Scheduling (ICMS), is based on a novel message exchange mechanism to allow optimization of job scheduling metrics. The resulting system offers improved flexibility, robustness and decentralization. We implemented a toolkit named "Simulating the Inter-Cloud" (SimIC) to perform the design and implementation of different inter-cloud entities and policies in the ICMS framework. An experimental analysis is produced and an improved performance is observed for a number of parameters such as job execution, makespan, and turnaround times. The results highlight that the overall performance of individual clouds is improved when these are brought together under the proposed ICMS framework. © 2015 IEEE.},

While the abundance of computing resources at low cost opens up many possibilities for migrating applications to the cloud, this migration also comes at a price.

In moving applications to the cloud, application developers face the challenge of balancing these dependencies to avoid vendor lock-in.

We also present our theoretical basis and experience in two practical projects where we have applied the abstraction-driven approach. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing has made the use of IT services more accessible and cheap. Resources are easily configurable and accessible using networked client devices and are characterised by particular agility and efficiency of use that allows to scale dynamically and on demand. However, owing to the current lack of standards and to the heterogeneity of technologies, users have little flexibility in choosing from alternative providers simultaneously in order to optimise resources at different levels so being affected by the vendor lock-in problem. In this paper, we address the problem of interoperability at IaaS level by proposing an agent abstraction, the vendor agent that is a wrapper to a specific provider technology, and its implementation to support two well-known cloud platforms: Open Nebula and Amazon. This abstraction represents a key driver towards interoperability giving users the opportunity to choose and use services provided by many different cloud vendors.

abstract={A single cloud provider alone is not able to satisfy the increasing demand for its services as the number of online users and services deployed by organizations grow exponentially. To achieve the promises of cloud computing, the necessity of aggregating different cloud provider into a single framework emerges. This concept overcomes the limitations of interoperability, portability, vendor lock in problem, scalability and elasticity of contemporary cloud computing. Collaborating with different cloud providers is not an easy task because each cloud provider has different kinds of architecture, virtualization technology, service level agreement, enterprise solution and interface for accessing services. This scenario is identified by many synonyms in the literature such as cloud federation, Inter-cloud, Multi-Cloud etc. This paper discusses various driving forces and advantages that attract researchers towards it. Further, this paper concentrates on exploring related work done in addressing different issues and finding gaps that will create opportunities for further research and development. This work will tend to emerge as a step towards the next-generation enterprise solution. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={(1) Background, Motivation and Objective: Academic study of Cloud Computing within Saudi Arabia is an emerging research field. Saudi Arabia represents the largest economy in the Arabian Gulf region. This positions it as a potential market of cloud computing technologies. Adoption of new innovations should be preceded by analysis of the added value, challenges and adequacy from technological, organizational and environmental perspectives. (2) Statement of Contribution/Method: This cross-sectional exploratory empirical research is based on Technology, Organization and Environment model targeting higher education institutions. In this study, the factors that influence the adoption by higher education institutions were analyzed and tested using Partial Least Square. (3) Results, Discussion and Conclusions: Three factors were found significant in this context. Relative Advantage, Data Privacy and Complexity are the most significant factors. The model explained 43% of the total adoption measure variation. Significant differences in the areas of cloud computing compatibility, complexity, vendor lock-in and peer pressure between large and small institutions were revealed. Items for future cloud computing research were explored through open-ended questions. Adoption of cloud services by higher education institutions has been started. It was found that the adoption rate among large universities is higher than small higher education institutions. Improving the network and Internet Infrastructure in Saudi Arabia at an affordable cost is a pre-requisite for cloud computing adoption. Cloud service provider should address the privacy and complexity concerns raised by non-adopters. Future information systems that are potential for hosting in cloud were prioritized. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is the state of the art computation paradigm enabling providers to offer computing resources to customers in a pay-per-use fashion. Nowadays public Cloud providers offer similar services within few service models, mainly IaaS and PaaS. Cloud providers give to the user the feeling to dispose of infinite resources, thus having to predict the user requirements in order to provide services with minimal costs, maintaining at the same time high levels of SLAs. In order to achieve this goal, Cloud providers can cooperate together to bring new business opportunities, such as expanding available resources, achieving cost effective asset optimization and adopting power saving policies. Cloud Federation allows different Cloud providers the opportunity to work collaboratively to offer best services to customers and contemporary to improve their productivity. Customers can advantage from Cloud Federation for a larger offer of available services, the capability of price comparison and the removal of vendor lock-in. In this paper we describe a platform that enables the federation of several heterogeneous Cloud Providers to allow the customers choosing and activating Cloud services from a central platform, bringing more attractive price policy to customers. The authors introduce a prototype of Cloud Federation platform based on a central infrastructure tested to manage OpenStack, CloudStack and Amazon EC2 providers, thus allowing the user to select the best services in terms of either technical requirements or price policy and activate them without having to explicitly register to each of the federated providers. The prototype is designed to accept different types of Cloud service models by means of transparent interfaces developed around a billing and a metering module, respectively to bill the service to the customer and to collect information about the health status of the federated platforms. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing has gained the popularity of todays IT sector because of the low cost involved in setup, ease of resource configuration and maintenance. The increase in the number of cloud providers in the market has led to availability of a wide range of cloud solutions offered to the consumers. These solutions are based on different cloud architectures and usually are incompatible with each other. It is very hard to find a single provider which offers all services the end users need. Cloud providers offer proprietary solutions that force cloud customers to decide the design and deployment models as well as the technology at the early stages of software development. One of the major issues of this paradigm is; the applications and services hosted with a specific cloud provider are locked to their specific implementation technique and operational methods. Hence, moving these applications and services to another provider is a tedious task. This situation is often termed as vendor lock-in. Hence a way to provide portability of applications across multiple clouds is a major concern. According to the literature very few efforts have been made in order to propose a unified standard for cloud computing. DSkyL provides a way for reducing the cloud migration efforts. This chapter aims to sketch the architecture of DSkyL and the major steps involved in the migration process. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Cloud-based systems are becoming an increasingly attractive target for malicious attacks. In IaaS environments, malicious attacks on a cloud customer’s virtual machine may affect the customer, who cannot use all diagnostic means that are available in dedicated in-house infrastructures, as well as the cloud provider, due to possible subsequent attacks against the cloud infrastructure and other co-hosted customers. This paper presents an integrated approach towards forensics and incident analysis in IaaS cloud environments. The proposed architecture enables the cloud provider to securely offer forensics services to its customers on a self-service platform. The architecture combines three important analysis techniques and provides significantly better investigation capabilities than existing systems: First, it supports host-based forensics based on virtual machine introspection. Second, it offers live remote capture of network traffic. Third, and most importantly, it provides hybrid combinations of the first two techniques, which enables enhanced analysis capabilities such as support for monitoring encrypted communication. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

abstract={The Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of death from cancer in the developed regions. In this paper we address the necessity to develop tools by which the oncologists will easily identify molecular targets for treatment and perform immediate diagnosis. Considering the increase of available microarray experiments and the DNA chips' potentiality for extracting knowledge from the genes' expressions, we present the design of a new platform for CRC gene expression analysis whose usage target are both the researchers and the medical persons. The platform is set on predefined and original statistical methodologies for accurate inference in CRC, biomarkers extraction, CRC stage prognosis, etc. In order to avoid the limitations of the local infrastructure, the proposed architecture takes the advantage of the cloud's speed and flexibility to perform large-scale computations and to be easily upgradable with new tools. The platform we present is equivalent to the Software as a Service level of abstraction from an end-user point of view. From a developer's point of view, we use the Platform as a Service level of abstraction, which means we control virtualized instances that are already offered by the Cloud Service Provider. Those instances are set on the Infrastructure as a Service level of the cloud, its storing and processing capacity. Mainly, the platform is comprised of four distinctive modules: User Interface - interface between the user, the software and the biological databases; Machine Learning - the core where the data is processed; Distributed Processing - splits and spreads the problem through the available instances; and Resources Controlling module - determines the best combination of resources in terms of performance and cost depending on the problem size. A detailed description of each module, as well as the latest concerns of cloud's interoperability and portability is discussed in the paper. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Design/methodology/approach – This is an explanatory paper that is based on literature review and empirical data on exploring reasons for cloud computing service acquisitions. A combination of interviews and focus group discussions was used as methods for data collection. Information technology and electronic banking executives of five major commercial banks in Accra, Ghana, between January and July 2013 were interviewed. A total of ten respondents were interviewed, two in each of the selected banks. A purposive sampling technique was used in the selection of informants. This approach allows the selection of qualified informants to ensure extensiveness and diversity of opinion.
Findings – Although previous literature proffers various factors as key to cloud computing adoption, uses or provisioning, this study brings trust to the fore as an imperative for cloud computing service acquisition by financial institutions. It also shows that trust increases if users perceive that cloud computing service providers act in honesty and in users’ interest, making trust a fundamental factor that informs financial institutions’ decision to acquire cloud computing services.
Research limitations/implications – The research introduces a new dimension about the widely held perceptions of the factors that influence adoption of cloud computing services.
Practical implications – Developers of cloud computing solutions that are targeted at corporate users must focus on systems that enhances their trustworthiness, as it is a primary criteria for user buy-in. Similarly, any trust-building effort by cloud computing service providers minimizes users’ concerns and pushes the services providers closer to the trust threshold.
Originality/value – The paper outlines the trust factors that are imperative for cloud computing uses by financial institutions. This is one of the pioneering papers that address trust issues in cloud computing from the perspective of financial institutions.
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explain the role of trust in cloud computing services based on empirical evidence from interviewing executives of financial institutions in Ghana. The paper answers the questions: what is the role of trust in cloud computing service acquisition, and what policies promote trusted cloud computing services? © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Migrating business services to the clouds creates many high business risks such as "cloud vendor lock-in". One approach for preventing this risk is to deploy business services on different clouds as SaaS (i.e., Software as a Service) services. Unfortunately, such SaaS multi-cloud deployment approach faces many technical obstacles such as clouds heterogeneity and ensuring data consistency across different clouds. Cloud heterogeneity could be easily resolved using service adapters, but ensuring data consistency remains a major obstacle, as existing approaches offer a trade-off between correctness and performance. Hence, SaaS providers opt to choose one or more of these approaches at design time, then create their services based on the limitations of the chosen approaches. This approach limits the agility and evolution of business services, as it tightly couples them to the chosen data consistency approaches. To overcome such problem, this paper proposes SULTAN, a composite data consistency approach for SaaS multi-cloud deployment. It enables SaaS providers to dynamically define different data consistency requirements for the same SaaS service at run-time. SULTAN decouples the SaaS services from the cloud data stores, enabling services to adapt and migrate freely among clouds without any SaaS code modifications. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Platform as a Service (PaaS) has become a strong technological solution in particular for small medium enterprises (SMEs) to achieve cost savings and rapid time to market of their software solutions. However, for SMEs how to choose the PaaS provider becomes a bottleneck due to the number of offerings each PaaS vendor offers. Another challenge often faced by enterprises is how to match their software system requirements to PaaS offerings. Furthermore, searching for the best PaaS offering is even more difficult when enterprises need to migrate their existing software solutions from one PaaS vendor to another. In such cases, the portability of the enterprises data and application components becomes cumbersome. If their software solutions are bound to a specific PaaS provider, enterprises suffer from vendor lock-in.

abstract={Even though the cloud era has begun almost one decade ago, many problems of the first hour are still around. Vendor lock-in and poor tool support hinder users from taking full advantage of main cloud features: dynamic and scale. This has given rise to tools that target the seamless management and orchestration of cloud applications. All these tools promise similar capabilities and are barely distinguishable what makes it hard to select the right tool. In this paper, we objectively investigate required and desired features of such tools and give a definition of them. We then select three open-source tools (Brooklyn, Cloudify, Stratos) and compare them according to the features they support using our experience gained from deploying and operating a standard three-tier application. This exercise leads to a fine-grained feature list that enables the comparison of such tools based on objective criteria as well as a rating of three popular cloud orchestration tools. In addition, it leads to the insight that the tools are on the right track, but that further development and particularly research is necessary to satisfy all demands. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Network technologies have always been a crucial part of success for technologies like cloud computing. But due to the slow development of a scalable IT infrastructure, this can lead to issues in competitiveness. Software defined networking (SDN) can thereby counteract such issues by giving new functions to the whole network topology. With SDN, administrators have the possibility to abstract the underlying network infrastructure for applications and network services. The paper reports on the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on challenges and effects of SDN. It shows that most papers address the implementation of software defined networking as a challenge, including factors like vendor lock-in and the general risk of changing traditional network architectures. Attention is also given to security issues arising with software defined networks and the permanent high demand from the end-user combined with the fear of changing traditional networks. Issues dealing with specialized know-how were identified as another challenge category. Effects of SDN are discussed by defining unique features of SDN like decoupling hardware from the software and the global view of the whole network architecture. SDN furthermore affects the management of the network, including changes in deployment of policies, the programmability and maintenance of the network. Economic factors, such as cost efficiency and reduction of costs, are also discussed. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the rapid development of cloud storage technology, more and more companies are beginning to upload data to the cloud storage platform. However, solely depending on the particular cloud storage provider has a number of potentially serious problems, such as vendor lock-in, availability, and security issues. To address the problems, we propose a deduplication-based primary storage system in cloud-of-clouds in this paper by eliminating the redundant data block in the cloud computing environment and distributing the data among multiple independent cloud storage providers. The data is stored in multiple cloud storage providers by combining the replication and erasure code schemes. The replication way is easy to implement and deploy but has high storage overhead. The storage overhead of erasure code is small, but it requires computational overhead for encode and decode operations. To better utilize the advantages of both replication and erasure code schemes and to exploit the reference characteristics in data deduplication, the high referenced data blocks are stored with replication scheme and the other data blocks are stored with erasure code scheme. The experiments conducted on our lightweight prototype implementation of new system show that the deduplication-based primary storage system in cloud-of-clouds improves the performance and cost efficiency significantly than the existing schemes. ©, 2015, Science Press.

abstract={Numerous services are developed using cloud computing technology. It is possible to use service from remote location, not in place of local computer. Accordingly, the research groups predict that the scale of cloud service also will be grown. One of cloud computing's advantage is scalability. It can extend its service scale and range using collaboration between cloud service providers. To make it possible, however, interoperability is required in that environment. Cross-Layered SLA architecture is the cloud service environment that supports interoperability. In this paper, we propose aggregation functions and quality model for QoE metrics and newly generating Service Level Agreement in cross-layered SLA architecture. We expect that this aggregation function and quality model will solve the possible problems in the cloud service area. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing has been introduced as a solution to several problems of the traditional web-based e-learning system, such as a limited storage, a high infrastructure maintenance costs and a low interoperability among the component of web-based e-learning system. However, the cloud computing system performance may deteriorate with increasing number of users and become worse when many users access the video streaming from the cloud system. This is due to the centralized architecture of the cloud computing that can generate network traffic congestion and bottleneck in the cloud servers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture has been proposed to overcome this problem. Using P2P, all nodes in the cloud system can act as servers as well as clients at the same time for reducing the congestion and bottleneck of the system. Currently, there are few reviews on P2P video streaming although intensive studies have been done on the development of the system. With this condition, identifying and understanding the development of P2P video streaming will be expensive, time consuming and physically exhausting. The objective of this paper is to review the latest development of P2P video streaming based on cloud computing. A narrative review method has been used as the methodology for investigating the P2P video streaming' articles from 2009 to 2014. The outcomes of this research shows that 90% of cloud based e-learning integrate with P2P when it's involving streaming video. © 2015 The Authors.},

The core principles are based on visualization of computational resources' detailed interactions within geographically distributed platform. Our goal was to make a visualization provision tool for more effective understanding, monitoring and managing infrastructure with easy-to-use interface especially for the users who do not have enough technical background to efficiently organize their interoperability with the infrastructure level of the platform CLAVIRE. To manage with this issue, we developed a client-based application that includes a special algorithm based on force-directed graph layout, which is able to represent all aforementioned information on clear and understandable level. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={The challenges that Cloud computing poses to business processes integration, emphasize the need for addressing two major issues: (i) which integration approach should be used allowing an adequate description of interaction aspects of the composed software components ? (ii) how are these interaction descriptions stored and shared to allow other software artifacts to (re)use them ? To address these issues, in this paper the authors propose an Agent Interaction Protocols (AiP)-based approach for reusing and aggregating existing Cloud services to create a new desired business application. The proposed approach facilitates rapid development and provisioning of composite Cloud services by specifying what to compose as an AiP. Furthermore, the authors develop an agent-based architecture that supports flexible scaling of business processes in a virtualized Cloud computing environment. The main goal of the proposed architecture is to address and tackle interoperability challenges at the Cloud application level. It solves the interoperability issues between heterogeneous Cloud services environments by offering a harmonized API. Also, it enables the deployment of applications at public, private or hybrid multi-Cloud environments. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.},

Different requirements, ranging from interoperability and portability, provisioning and reconfiguration, security and privacy, or monitoring and auditing, can all be controlled through the lifecycle support of cloud services and grouped under the umbrella of different virtual enterprises. A semantic support is essential to enable such an entity, and to foster collaboration among different virtual enterprises by providing specific mechanisms by which the construction of complex services from elementary building blocks can be made possible. At the same time it actively supports tasks like automation of cloud resource usage, efficient monitoring and scaling of cloud services, either individually or based on specific dependencies, or replacement and termination of services when the initial offers are no longer available.

abstract={Many IT service platforms (e.g.; cloud computing platforms) are built as closed systems. They do not allow their customers to interoperate with other platforms or port their data to other platforms. As switching to a different system is costly, customers of a closed IT system can be considered locked in. Consequently, potential customers, who are aware of this lock-in issue, do not adopt cloud services. Opening up an IT service platform, however, reduces users' concerns about lock-in and its associated switching cost. It is even predicted that an IT service platform gets more attractive, if it opens up. This paper validates this prediction by analyzing the level of openness (i.e.; interoperability, portability, and usability) of cloud computing platforms on their adoption. For the validation, we develop a value creation model for IT service platforms. Based on this value creation model and a specification of requirements of open cloud computing platforms, the relationship between the openness of IT service platforms and the adoption of IT service platforms (i.e.; attractiveness) is analyzed in detail. In particular, our results show that the level of openness plays a major role in the adoption of IT service platforms of emerging service providers. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Service level agreements (SLAs) are used to bind cloud provider for providing services and hence to assure cloud consumer that delivered services are up to the mark. However, most of the cloud SLAs are either static in nature or are concerned only for availability of service leaving major concerns such as performance, security, metering and monitoring, automation, and many more. In this paper, we have reviewed the existing SLA frameworks and then examined their suitability in the context of cloud computing. Next, we discuss the desirable components, which should be considered in cloud SLA. Also, we have identified different parameters that need to be incorporated in each component. Based on this, we put forward a cloud SLA template, which we termed as cloud service level agreement template (CSLAT). This work attempts to provide a clear and formal definition of decisive parameters in cloud computing. The definition will give clear perception of how these parameters should be specified in SLA, so as to avoid any conflict rising due to ambiguity in it. Further, precise monitoring and QoS measurement can be done using the mathematical interpretations given corresponding to parameters. Thus, proposed CSLAT will help in automation of SLA management in cloud computing. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of death from cancer in the developed regions. In this paper we address the necessity to develop tools by which the oncologists will easily identify molecular targets for treatment and perform immediate diagnosis. Considering the increase of available microarray experiments and the DNA chips' potentiality for extracting knowledge from the genes' expressions, we present the design of a new platform for CRC gene expression analysis whose usage target are both the researchers and the medical persons. The platform is set on predefined and original statistical methodologies for accurate inference in CRC, biomarkers extraction, CRC stage prognosis, etc. In order to avoid the limitations of the local infrastructure, the proposed architecture takes the advantage of the cloud's speed and flexibility to perform large-scale computations and to be easily upgradable with new tools. The platform we present is equivalent to the Software as a Service level of abstraction from an end-user point of view. From a developer's point of view, we use the Platform as a Service level of abstraction, which means we control virtualized instances that are already offered by the Cloud Service Provider. Those instances are set on the Infrastructure as a Service level of the cloud, its storing and processing capacity. Mainly, the platform is comprised of four distinctive modules: User Interface - interface between the user, the software and the biological databases; Machine Learning - the core where the data is processed; Distributed Processing - splits and spreads the problem through the available instances; and Resources Controlling module - determines the best combination of resources in terms of performance and cost depending on the problem size. A detailed description of each module, as well as the latest concerns of cloud's interoperability and portability is discussed in the paper. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Cloud federation is foreseen to happen among large cloud providers. The resulting interoperability of cloud services among these providers will then increase even more the elasticity of cloud services. The cloud provisioned that is targeted by this scenario is mainly one which combines the cloud services offered by large enterprises. Cloud computing, however, has started moving to the edge. We now increasingly see the tendency to fullfil cloud computing requirements by multiple levels and different kind of infrastructures, where the Fog Computing paradigm has started playing its role. For this scenario of edge computing, we show in this paper the case of the federation of multiple independent micro-cloud providers within a community network, where providers pool their resources and services into a community cloud. Federation happens here primarily at the service level and the domain of trust is the community of practice. While we can today already report this case in the context of community networks, IPv6 deployment in the Internet will principally allow micro-cloud providers to appear everywhere, needing cloud federation mechanisms. We describe for a real case how this micro-cloud provider federation has been built and argue why micro-cloud provider should be considered for the integration in cloud federations. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={During the past years the Cloud Computing offer has exponentially grown, with new Cloud providers, platforms and services being introduced in the IT market. The extreme variety of services, often providing non uniform and incompatible interfaces, makes it hard for customers to decide how to develop, or even worse to migrate, their own application into the Cloud. This situation can only get worse when customers want to exploit services from different providers, because of the portability and interoperability issues that often arise. In this paper we propose a uniform, integrated, machine-readable, semantic representation of cloud services, patterns, appliances and their compositions. Our approach aims at supporting the development of new applications for the Cloud environment, using semantic models and automatic reasoning to enhance potability and interoperability when multiple platforms are involved. In particular, the proposed reasoning procedure allows to: perform automatic discovery of Cloud services and Appliances; map between agnostic and vendor dependent Cloud Patterns and Services; automatically enrich the semantic knowledge base. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is being adopted more and more in recent years. It offers several benefits, such as high elasticity, availability and cost reduction, but yet presents some issues. Among the most important, the potential lack of security can affect the spreading of this technology. As cloud computing is pushing forward to the digital era, where users can have their own digital identity to access restricted resources or services, a reliable authentication and authorization system would attract more users to get involved in such process. This paper proposes an integration of the VOMS (Virtual Organization Membership Service) system for authorization and SPID (Sistema Pubblico per la gestione dell'Identità Digitale) system for authentication, within Cloud Foundry PaaS (Platform as a Service) model. Considerations, differences and interoperability matters will be addressed in order to provide a comprehensive scheme.},

Our ontology's design is based on a layered model of cloud computing where lower layers provide shared services to higher layers. It focuses on the submission of generic Submission Information Packages with PREMIS preservation metadata. An ontology is designed to define a common vocabulary for cloud archives, and define the roles and responsibilities for data creation and transfer, including the registration of cloud-based content creation systems. We define the classes, object properties, data properties and annotations necessary to describe the agents, objects, events and rights that comprise a cloud archive. We evaluated the ontology with a prototype system, using real-world examples of cloud systems, digital objects and metadata. We found that the ontology was able to describe the chosen components successfully, and that it improved metadata interoperability between content creating applications and the services providing preservation metadata.

abstract={Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is a relatively new concept that leverages the combination of cloud technology, mobile computing, and wireless networking to enrich the usability experiences of mobile users. Many field of application such as mobile health, mobile learning, mobile commerce and mobile entertainment are now taking advantage of MCC technologies. Since MCC is new, there is need to advance research in MCC in order to deepen practice. Currently, what exist are mostly descriptive literature reviews in the area of MCC. In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR), which offers a structured, methodical, and rigorous approach to the understanding of the trend of research in MCC, and the least and most researched issue is presented. The objective of the study is to provide a credible intellectual guide for upcoming researchers in MCC to help them identify areas in MCC research where they can make the most impact. The SLR was limited to peer-reviewed conference papers and journal articles published from 2002 to 2014. The study reveals that privacy, security and trust in MCC are the least researched, whereas issues of architecture, context awareness and data management have been averagely researched, while issues on operations, end users, service and applications have received a lot of attention in the literature. © 2015 SERSC.},

abstract={Cloud computing enables a new supplement of consumption and delivery model for internet based services and protocol. It helps to provide software, hardware and data in form of collaborative services on the demand of the end user. To meet the QoS and ensure high interoperability and scalability is one of the most challenging tasks for cloud service provider. However, there are also several technical challenges that need to be tackled before the benefits can be fully realized. Among them reliability, resource provisioning, and efficient resources consuming etc are major concern. Load balancing also one of them. It includes selecting a proper node that must be full filled end user demand and also distribution of dynamic workload evenly into the multiple nodes. So load balancing can be described as an optimization problem and should be adapting nature due to the changing needs. In this paper we suggest a novel load balancing strategy to search under loaded node to balance load from overwhelmed node. CloudAnalyst used as a simulation tool for the proposed load balancing strategy. Experimental results of the sample application are really very encouraging. Significantly the results of the proposed algorithm are compared and outperformed the traditional strategy like First Come First Serve(FCFS), local search algorithm like Stochastic Hill Climbing(SHC) and soft computing approaches like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization(ACO). © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={As distributed, on-line communities are increasingly supported by the global, interconnected computing infrastructure, methods must be developed to securely manage their interactions. The virtual organization (VO) concept provides a security and discovery context whereby collaboration across multiple administrative domains can be enabled while enforcing joint security policies. In the era of cloud computing, VOs can be used to manage 'community clouds', i.e., Cloud federations. In this paper, we describe a method for re-purposing the Open Stack Keystone service to act as a VO Management System (VOMS) called Key VOMS. With minor changes, it can be used to manage access to services that are registered for use by members of any given VO. These services can be arbitrary infrastructure-level or application-level services. This is illustrated by using Key VOMS to manage access to a set of RSS feed topics. While very flexible, the use of an external, third-party, such as Key VOMS, raises fundamental semantic interoperability and trust delegation issues that must be addressed in future work. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={During the past few years, cloud computing has become a key IT buzzword. A growing number of cloud providers started to expose their own services to the market, to answer consumer's need, engaging a competition in the attempt to offer the easiest access to resources and the widest catalogue of services. However, the current lack of a shared standard for the description of such services can represent an obstacle to the development of interoperable and portable cloud solutions. In this scenario, developers could benefit from an automatic tool or technique to identify the architectural solution best answering their requests. In this work we are presenting our approach to the semantic description of cloud resources, comprehending both a general and agnostic representation of such services and a focus on provider specific solutions. Also, we illustrate how the proposed description can be queried and further extended, by means of logical rules, in order to retrieve and assess new information on services equivalences.

abstract={Cloud Computing platforms offer diverse services and capabilities with own features. Hence, the provider services could be used by end users to compose a heterogeneous context of multiple cloud platforms in order to deploy their cloud applications made up of a set of modules, according to the best capabilities of the cloud providers. However, this is an ideal scenario, since the cloud platforms are being conducted in an isolated way by presenting many interoperability and portability restrictions, which complicate the integration of diverse provider services to achieve an heterogeneous deployment of multi-cloud applications. In this ongoing work, we present an approach based on model transformation to deploy multi-cloud applications by reusing standardization efforts related to the management and deployment of cloud applications. Specifically, using mechanisms specified by both standards, TOSCA and CAMP, we propose a methodology to describe the topology and distribution of modules of a cloud application and to deploy the interconnected modules over heterogeneous clouds. We illustrate our idea using a running example. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={In order to improve simulation performance and to integrate simulation resources among geographically distributed locations, the concept of distributed simulation is proposed. Several types of distributed simulation standards, such as DIS and HLA, are established to formalize simulations and achieve reusability and interoperability of simulation components. To implement these distributed simulation standards and to manage the underlying system of distributed simulation applications, we employ Grid Computing and Cloud Computing technologies. These tackle the details of operation, configuration, and maintenance of simulation platforms in which simulation applications are deployed. However, for modelers who may not be familiar with the management of distributed systems, it is challenging to make a simulation-run-ready environment among different types of computing resources and network environments. In this article, a new multi-layered cloud-based scheme is proposed for enabling modeling and simulation based on different distributed simulation standards. This scheme is designed to ease the management of underlying resources and to achieve rapid elasticity that can provide unlimited computing capability to end users; it considers energy consumption, security, multi-user availability, scalability, and deployment issues. A mechanism for handling diverse network environments is described; by adopting it, idle public resources can be easily configured as additional computing capabilities for the local resource pool. A fast deployment model is built to relieve the migration and installation process of this platform. An energy-saving strategy is utilized to reduce the consumption of computing resources. Security components are implemented to protect sensitive information and block malicious attacks in the cloud. In the experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with its corresponding grid computing platform; the cloud computing platform achieves similar performance, but incorporates many advantages that the Cloud can provide. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is moving from being a testing ground for isolated projects to being a strategic approach of the entire business organization. So the choice among the possible cloud offers, with a strong focus on the choice of services that enable better processes and projects of the business lines, is gaining importance. Nevertheless the heterogeneity of the Cloud services, resources, technology and service levels offered by the several providers make difficult to decide. Besides the inconveniences caused by the “lock-in”, give rise to the need for developers to be able to develop an application regardless of where it is released, structuring and building it in a vendor agnostic way so that it is possible to deploy on the provider that best fits them at the moment. The mOSAIC project aims at designing and developing an innovative open-source API and platform that enables applications to be Cloud providers’ neutral and to negotiate Cloud services as requested by their users, allowing automatic discovery, matchmaking, and thus supporting selection, brokering, interoperability end even composition of Cloud Services among multiple Clouds. In this paper, we illustrate the interoperation of the two components, the Semantic Engine and the Cloud Agency for the agnostic retrieval, discovery and brokering of cloud services. The focus will be put on the way to support the Cloud Application Developer to express the requirements and services/resources in vendor agnostic way and to translate automatically these requirements into a neutral format in order to compare it with the different offers of providers and to broker the best one according to defined policies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={The smart data continuum refers to a series of increasingly semantically expressive definitions for data elements. With increased semantics we can achieve semantic interoperability, i.e., the ability of computer systems to exchange data with unambiguous and shared meaning. In context of smart homes it offers advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications. In order to achieve semantic interoperability in smart homes we have developed Smart Home Ontology, which gives semantics for the data that are exchanged by the systems and devices in a smart home. From technology point of view, we have studied the combination of cloud computing and Internet of Things as they enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual "things", thus stimulating innovations in both fields. Further, we will show how the principles of the Linked Data allow the integration of Smart Home data with other data sources, and thus increases the usability of Smart Home data. In particular we have restricted on health monitoring data. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={The process of provisioning healthcare involves massive healthcare data which exists in different forms on disparate data sources and in different formats. Consequently, health information systems encounter interoperability problems at many levels. Integrating these disparate systems requires the support at all levels of a very expensive infrastructures. Cloud computing dramatically reduces the expense and complexity of managing IT systems. Business customers do not need to invest in their own costly IT infrastructure, but can delegate and deploy their services effectively to Cloud vendors and service providers. It is inevitable that electronic health records (EHRs) and healthcare-related services will be deployed on cloud platforms to reduce the cost and complexity of handling and integrating medical records while improving efficiency and accuracy. The paper presents a review of EHR including definitions, EHR file formats, structures leading to the discussion of interoperability and security issues. The paper also presents challenges that have to be addressed for realizing Cloudbased healthcare systems: data protection and big health data management. Finally, the paper presents an active data model for housing and protecting EHRs in a Cloud environment.},

abstract={Cloud Computing has emerged as a new paradigm in the field of network-based services within many industrial and application domains. The major benefits that it provides in terms of IT efficiency and business agility represent a huge competitive advantage for an organization. However, building new services in the cloud or designing cloud-based solutions into existing business context in general is a complex decision process involving many factors. In this paper, we undertake a systematic review to obtain an overview of the existing studies in designing cloud-based solutions. In particular, we investigate the main challenges and concerns when building cloud-based architectures and different architectural approaches and design considerations that are proposed in literatures to meet these specific concerns. The search strategy identified 72 studies that were catalogued as primary studies for this review after using multi-step selection process. The main challenges and concerns are classified into four main categories: security and trustworthiness, elasticity, portability and interoperability, and cloud resilience. We have also categorized studies that describe architectural approaches and design considerations when architecting for the cloud. Implications for research and practice are presented as well. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={With the growing popularity of cloud computing and large number of providers, it is necessary to select the most appropriate service. To select a suitable provider the user needs to browse a huge list of providers. To solve this problem, the customer can use a third-party service called a cloud broker. One of the problem we faced during the developing cloud broker framework is a lack of API standards. Every provider has its own protocol for deploying services. This paper describes a new approach to construct a protocol for communication between the client and the provider. It is based on the use of mediators, which, depending on the selected service capable to convert messages from a format of one particular provider to a format of another provider. All the processes described in a specific example of Google Compute Engine client and Digital Ocean server interactions for deploying the service. In addition, during the development of mediators was introduced a new operator “sync” to synchronize the set of answers to one. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={As an emerging trend for maximizing IT resource utilization, cloud federation raises various technical, economic, and legal issues. In order to understand the future of its adoption among cloud providers, it is important to identify which factors can be driving or inhibiting the process. This study aims at closing this research gap and find out the strength of their inhibiting or facilitating factors. After a thorough review of previous studies, factors suggested by relevant studies as determinants of cloud computing are compiled. Among those determinants, the most relevant factors are selected and, then, used to construct a model of hypothesized relationships of the determinants with the perception of risk and benefits of cloud federation, thus with the intention of joining a cloud federation. Data from a total of 300 cloud service providers, consultants, and IT experts were collected through a survey questionnaire. Questions were asked regarding large firms and small firms. The model is evaluated using structural equation modeling. The findings show that, among the six determinants analyzed by the study, flexibility and competitive pressure showed strong positive impacts. Thus, they are considered the major drivers of cloud federation. Furthermore, interoperability, service quality decline, and legal issues could be linked to be strong inhibitors of cloud federation. However, all these determines are strongly mediated by the perceived risk and perceived benefit of cloud federation. The estimated results for cloud providers showed that large cloud providers are attracted to cloud federation due to the potential of offering flexible services, while small cloud providers are driven by competitive pressure to join a cloud federation.},

abstract={This track started with the first Cloud Computing session in WETICE2009 with the observation that the cloud computing evolution depends on research efforts from the infrastructure providers creating next generation hardware that is service friendly, service developers that embed business service intelligence in the network to create distributed business workflow execution, assure service delivery on a massive scale with global interoperability while dealing with non-functional requirements such as security, availability, performance, compliance, cost and fluctuations both in resources and workloads. It was pointed out that the architecture and evolution of the cloud is increasing data enter complexity by piling up new layers of management over the many layers that already exist. Current session proves the epigram by Jean-Baptiste (1849) 'plus ça change, plus c'est la mêeme chose.' Literally 'The more it changes, the more it's the same thing'. In this conference, one paper presents the result of the discussions started in these sessions in 2009 that led to a policy based dynamic workflow orchestration independent of the infrastructure orchestration which eliminates the need for moving Virtual Machine images and interfaces to myriad infrastructure management systems at runtime. The architecture is derived from the well-understood and time-tested distributed systems such as cellular organisms, human organizational structures and telecommunication networks. In addition, eight full papers and three short papers continue to make progress on current state of the art. Based on the papers presented in these sessions over the last six years, we boldly predict that we are on the verge of a synthesis of the thesis of current state of the art and the anti-thesis of increasing complexity to address scaling and fluctuations in distributed systems. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is the blending technology of parallel and distributing computing, and its main aim is providing Everything as a Service to the consumers. The private cloud is one of the deployment models and it offers resources in an on-demand manner. Resource Management is the challenging task between different private cloud because of the interoperability issues since the private clouds are managed by different type of cloud middleware's and each of them has their own mechanism and protocols. To manage the resource efficiently and to increase the resource availability it is essential to overcome the interoperability issues between the private clouds. In this paper a common mechanism called Semantic Cloud Resource Broker (SCRB) is introduced between the Eucalyptus and Open Nebula based private clouds. It also includes the semantic technology to achieve meaningful search. Hence an OWL-based ontology indexing and retrieval algorithms is implemented to improve precision and recall and thereby improves the success rate of cloud resources. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Modelling & Simulation (M&S) is broadly used in real scenarios where making physical modifications could be highly expensive. With the so-called Simulation Software-as-a-Service (SimSaaS), researchers could take advantage of the huge amount of resource that cloud computing provides. Even so, studying and analysing a problem through simulation may need several simulation tools, hence raising interoperability issues. Having this in mind, IEEE developed a standard for interoperability among simulators named High Level Architecture (HLA). Moreover, the multi-agent system approach has become recognised as a convenient approach for modelling and simulating complex systems. Despite all the recent works and acceptance of these technologies, there is still a great lack of work regarding synergies among them. This paper shows by means of a literature review this lack of work or, in other words, the sparse Cloud SimSaaS. The literature review and the resulting taxonomy are the main contributions of this paper, as they provide a research agenda illustrating future research opportunities and trends.},

However, due to the excess usage and ever-evolving nature of biomedical data, ontologies are becoming large-scale, and complex; consequently, requiring scalable computational environments with performance and availability in mind. In this paper, we present a cloud-based ontology matching system for biomedical ontologies that provides ontology matching as a service. Our proposed system implements parallelism at various levels to improve the overall ontology matching performance especially for large-scale biomedical ontologies and incorporates third-party resources UMLS and Wordnet for comprehensive matched results. Matched results are delivered to the service consumer as bridge ontology and preserved in ubiquitous ontology repository for future request. We evaluate our system by consuming the matching service in an interoperability engine of a clinical decision support system (CDSS), which generates mapping requests for FMA and NCI biomedical ontologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The main outcome of the paper is the definition of an architectural framework and associated research and development agenda for the application of cloud computing for the development and deployment of a Big Data Logistics Business Platform (BDLBP) for supply chain network management services. The capabilities embedded in the BDLBP can provide powerful decision support to logistics networking and stakeholders. Two of the three strategic and operational capabilities as operational capacity planning, and real-time route optimisation are built upon literature based on operational research, and are extended to the scope of dynamic and uncertain situations. The third capability, strategic logistics network planning is currently under researched and this approach aims at covering this capability supported by big data analytics in the cloud. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Summary Cloud federation can be described through the concept of collaboration, where each organization has its own cloud(s) that deals with a different and independent domain but needs to work together with other organizations in order to fulfill a specific shared objective. According to this perspective, the federation is a collection of interacting clouds that collaborate with one another through the instantiation and management of shared subsets of resources (computation and storage resources as well as sensors and actuators). This idea could be profitably used in those scenarios in which different organizations have to share several resources (e.g., emergency response or disaster management scenario). On the other hand, when different independent organizations share their resources, several issues arise. One of them is related to interoperability problems. As a consequence, this work also introduces a framework for an ontology-based resource life cycle management and provisioning in a federated cloud infrastructure. Therefore, The main contributions of this work consists of redesigning a cloud infrastructure architecture from the ground up, leveraging Semantic Web and Semantic Web Service Technologies, and natively supporting a federated provisioning of any kind of resource. This paper exploits, as a motivating scenario, a flood emergency response system. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={This paper first reviews the advancements in dam construction and development in hydraulic engineering, and summarizes the conceptualization of digital dam and its related research achievements. Then, we present an interpretation of the difference between the two concepts of digital dam and smart dam, based on a brief discussion on several disadvantages of digital dam, including insufficient depth in intelligent analysis of massive data and relatively low fusing level of site monitoring, simulation analysis and intelligent control. Smart dam is a new concept that is based on the digital dam conceptualization but emphasizes a specific form of dam development, i. e. adoption of new-generation information technologies as a basic means, such as Internet of things, intellectual technology, cloud computing, and big data. This concept also means a specific intelligent system of dam management and operation that is dynamic, refined, and perceivable in analysis and control. Besides, a smart dam often has distinctive features such as integrity, interoperability, fusion-expansibility, autonomy, and robustness. Third, we describe a basic framework of smart dams in detail, including a real-time information perception module, an interconnected real-time transmission module, an intelligent real-time analysis module, and an intelligent real-time management decision system, focusing on analysis of the progress and superiority of smart dams over digital dams in independent information collection, smart reconstruction analysis, intelligent decision, and integrated visualization. Finally, we explore key directions of smart dam research in fundamental theory, key technology, and management and operation system. © All right reserved.},

abstract={Disaster management that uses web-based technology to enhance user collaboration around disasters is an emergent field. A number of dedicated 'disaster portals' exist but they do not integrate large social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These social networking sites can facilitate the analysis and sharing of collective intelligence around disaster information on a far greater scale by increasing accessibility to, and the use of, a disaster portal. This paper presents the 'Riskr' project, which applies a low-technological solution to creating a disaster portal fed by social networking messages. The system has been implemented using Twitter and tested by users to determine the feasibility. Results suggest the combination of online services and interoperability between disaster portals; and social networks can further enhance disaster management initiatives as 70.5% of the users were able to estimate the correct location of a disaster (e.g. fallen power lines, fire).

abstract={Rapid advances in digitalization, Internet and world wide web enable the communication between two computing hosts across any location in the globe. Pervasive or ubiquitous computing enhanced this to a level that any two intelligent physical objects can communicate with each other, anytime and anywhere. Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm emerging from ubiquitous computing that facilitates communication between many real world objects by collaboration of various technologies. Integrating IoT with Cloud Computing derives manifold advantages to store and process enormous data generated by heterogeneous devices. Though both the technologies together have profound effect in many application areas like smart home, smart agriculture, healthcare etc., their integration involves many challenges. Security is one of the most important issues confronted by IoT-Cloud architecture. In this paper, we propose a Secure, Hybrid, Cloud Enabled architecture for IoT (SHCEI), which uses hybrid cloud (both public and private cloud). This architecture ensures security of intradomain data and will also address issues of scalability and interoperability. Further, we highlight some of the research challenges in implementing the combined architecture of Cloud and IoT. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Typical cloud computing systems provide highly scalable and fault-tolerant data stores that may sacrifice other features like general multi-item transaction support. Recently techniques to implement multi-item transactions in these types of systems have focused on transactions across homogeneous data stores. Since applications access data in heterogeneous storage systems for legacy or interoperability reasons, we propose an approach that enables multi-item transactions with snapshot isolation across multiple heterogeneous data stores using only a minimal set of commonly implemented features such as single item consistency, conditional updates, and the ability to store additional meta-data.We define an client-coordinated transaction commitment protocol that does not rely on a central coordinating infrastructure. The application can take advantage of the scalability and fault-tolerance characteristics of modern key-value stores and access existing data in them, and also have multi-item transactional access guarantees with little performance impact. We have implemented our design in a Java library called Cherry Garcia (CG), that supports data store abstractions to Windows Azure Storage (WAS), Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and our own high-performance key-value store called Tora. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Tools usually used until yet to manage flows of goods are mostly based on information systems such as ERP, WMS, APS, TMS, or other legacy systems. The advent of cloud computing (CC) and Internet of Things (IoT) adds the relevant information and events capture issue, transfer, storage, processing and sharing. Also, for a better collaboration and interoperability enhancement in supply chain, it is interesting to notify automatically each event related to logistic flows to involved actors. In order to remedy to these issues, we propose in this paper the architecture of a collaborative platform based on advanced technologies related to IoT, CC, GPS/GPRS and RFID for positioning, identification, communication, tracking and data sharing. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Taking advantage of the agility and interoperability provided by Service Oriented Architecture (SOA),Web 2.0 and XaaS (Anything as a Service) technologies, more and more collaborative Business Processes (BP) are set "on demand" by selecting, composing and orchestrating different business services depending on the current need. This involves re-thinking the way information, services and applications are organized, deployed, shared and secured among multi-cloud environment. Fitting this de-perimeterized and evolving execution context requires organising the service protection in a dynamic way in order to provide an up to date and consistent protection. To fit this goal, we propose to integrate the different protection requirements defined according to the business environment in a single security policy. Then we plug a context-aware security deployment architecture on the cloud service middleware to analyse both the security policy and the execution context to select, compose and orchestrate the convenient protection means. A proof of concept built on Frascati middleware is used to evaluate the impact of this "on-line" security mediation.},

abstract={Migrating to the cloud for the purpose of minimizing infrastructure costs and technical effort is a common trend these days. Over the last couple of years, we have witnessed an increasing demand for cloud computing, which lead to the increase of both cloud users, and cloud service providers as well. Due to the chaos of the various service providers, it is very difficult for a user to choose the appropriate provider that satisfies their specific requirements. A new research paradigm has emerged in an attempt to address this problem. Cloud interoperability is another issue that allows users to easily migrate applications and workloads across cloud service providers. The definition of a common standard between cloud providers has the ability of eliminating this issue. Another approach is the use of a cloud service broker, which assists users to find appropriate cloud service providers before the deployment of their application or service. A broker is capable of finding an appropriate service provider that would satisfy user service requirements in terms of a service level agreement. In this paper, two new cloud brokering algorithms, and their initial evaluation, are proposed. © 2015 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.},

abstract={Future smart cities would integrate a wide range of mostly heterogeneous systems and ICT is an essential asset in the coordination of those. The smart buildings, a major smart cities research and development domain, should advance beyond the complex automation tools and the anticipated energy and comfort envelope. The universal convergence to technologies that would enable the seamless integration with the anticipated smart cities urban environment should be highlighted. Although it is a concept widely accepted for current and future developing standards, it is much less communicated across scientific fields as for example the urban development and building automation. Even worse its necessity, in the latter, is frequently challenged. This paper firstly will try to address the market and scientific criticism towards a fully web-services enabled building in a fair and transparent approach. Secondly it proposes a system as an interoperability layer able to build advanced managements schemes by integrating the assets of current automation and monitoring systems to the Internet backbone.},

abstract={Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that provides agility to align technical solutions to modular business Web Services (WS) that are well decoupled from their consumers. This agility is established by interconnecting WS family of standards specification protocols (commonly referred to as WS-∗(WS-star)) to enable security, ease of service interoperability and orchestration complexities when extending services across organizational boundaries. While orchestrating services or chaining services in varying ways to satisfy different business needs, on highly scalable cloud platforms is undeniably useful, it is increasingly challenging to effectively monitor Quality of Service (QoS), especially, service response time. This is due to a) lack of proper formulation of the WS-star interconnections mechanisms, and b) the transient performance behaviour intrinsic to the heterogeneity of the hardware and shared virtualized network and IO resources built on the cloud platforms. We present an analysis of WS-star standards, classifying and discussing their inter-dependencies to provide a basis for QoS monitoring context on protocol formulation. We then illustrate a practical implementation of a dynamic QoS monitoring mechanism using runtime service instrumentation with Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). Preliminary evaluations show the efficiency of computing QoS on a transient performance cloud platform.},

abstract={To date a few, big providers dominate the market of Cloud resources. They provide proprietary solutions through inflexible pricing and SLA schemes. On the research side, the community is working to define specifications and standards on several aspects of the cloud technology. When standards will get mature, interoperability among clouds will be a reality. Customers will be no more locked-up to any proprietary technology and new players will have the chance to enter the market. The competition challenge will be played on the real capability of providers to accommodate customers’ requests in a flexible way and to supply high and differentiated QoS levels. In this market scenario a mechanism must be devised to support the matchmaking between what providers offer and what customers’ applications demand. In this work we propose the definition of a semantic model that helps customers and providers to characterize their demands/offers, and provide semantic tools performing the matchmaking in such a way to maximize both the provider’s profit and the customer’s utility. The proposal has been validated by running tests on a software prototype of the discovery framework. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Considerable efforts have been spent on designing architectures to manage heterogeneous resources across multiple administrative domains. Specific felds of application are federated cloud computing (Intercloud) approaches and distributed testbeds, among others. An important interoperability challenge that arises in this context is the exchange of information about the provided resources and their dependencies. Existing work usually rests upon schematic data models, which impede the discovery and management of heterogeneous resources between autonomous sites. One way of addressing this issue is to exchange semantic information models. In this paper, we exploit such approaches to formally defne federations, including their infrastructures and the life-cycle of the offered resources and services. The requirements of this work have been derived from several research projects and the results are in process of being standardized by an international body. The main contribution of this work is a higher level (upper) ontology and initial integration concepts for it. These contributions form a basis for further work in the general context of distributed semantic resource management. © 2015 IEEE.},

We leverage a logic based event specification language to represent patterns of events which occurrence can be evidence of security anomaly or breach or simply a sign of a nefarious use of the cloud infrastructure by some of its users. The use of dedicated algorithms for the detection of composite events coalesced with the definition of primitive events structure based on XCCDF format ensures the reuse and interoperability with security audit tools based on the Security Content and Automation Protocol-SCAP.

abstract={Internet of Things systems rely on the principles for service deployment and configuration based on delivery models. The predominant service delivery model for the Internet of Things architecture is a novel approach to create a global IoT system for Internet Connected Objects. While the service control loop has already been proposed (autonomics), the dynamic deployment of the different modules of an IoT system is still due. In this paper an approach for IoT service delivery model using autonomic management principles, which can deploy and configure IoT services is presented. The use of an implemented framework that helps administrator/user to deploy IoT platform(s) with autonomic methods has been developed. Particularly and as proof of concept example an open source platform (www.superstreamcollider.org) is used to demonstrate service instantiation. The agent-based framework analyses the requirements, dependencies and resolves them following autonomic design principles and also, by design, it deploys the IoT service delivery model into desired platform(s) running in the cloud or into a local machine. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Federated Identity Management (FIM) systems are well-known for achieving reliable and effective collaboration among various organizations. Despite numerous benefits, these systems have certain critical weaknesses such as lack of security and privacy while disseminating identity credentials (Personally Identifiable Information (PII)) across multiple federated Cloud environments. In addition to this, FIMsystems have limitations in terms of interoperability and lack compliance to international standards, since most of the systems are reliant on proprietary protocols for the exchange of identity information. In this regard, we propose a secure identity management system for federated Cloud environments that not only ensures the secure management of identity credentials, but preserves the privacy of Cloud Service Consumers (CSC) also. Furthermore, implementation of the proposed system involves state-of-the-art international standards (SCIM, SAML, REST and XACML) to ensure secure, quick and easy sharing & management of identity credentials in to, out of and around the Cloud. Further, we have performed rigorous evaluation of the proposed system using standard evaluation tools such as Scyther and JUnit. The results of our evaluation certify that the presented work ensures the desired features and level of security as expected from a secure identity management system for federated Cloud environment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={In the latest stock systems, a variety of technologies have been introduced to minimize low latency and accelerate data processing, and a massive amount of stock information has become interoperable. Only with the support of expensive network equipment, however, it is limited to increase the speed. Besides, it is not very effective to induce such equipment. Also, such stock information is hard to be shared in cloud environment for many reasons due to the heterogeneity of metadata. This makes it harder to optimize the proper time of data among stock trading systems as well. This study is going to suggest a stock trading system using X-DBaaS (XMDR-Database as a Service) in cloud environment. The suggested system applies SPT (Safe Proper Time) which can satisfy the proper time of data transmission and also minimize the CPI (Cycle Per Instruction) in order to reduce the CPU overhead based on the understanding of kernels. Moreover, XMDR-DAI is utilized to solve the heterogeneity issues among metadata and schemata taking place in the interoperation of information among stock systems. © 2015 SERSC.},

abstract={software with mobile-cloud integration is no longer a necessity but a need in modern day's technology trends. Industrial automation domain has been rather conservative towards adopting new technology changes. However efforts are being made to connect industrial automation software with mobile and cloud. An established protocol namely OPC UA is being experimented for this purpose. OPC UA is a leading industrial M2M communication protocol. It enables interoperable data exchange between applications from different vendors across different hardware platforms and operating systems. A systematic attempt to adopt the protocol to handheld devices like mobile phones, tablets and cloud platforms opens up new possibilities in the industrial automation domain. This forms the first step towards IOT integration with industrial devices. The opportunities here are not limited to controlling the plants, visualizing the data through smart devices. Additionally cloud platforms facilitate acquisition and processing of industrial data. The cloud's infrastructure capabilities can also help seamless communication with OPC UA conformant devices and applications across different geographies. This paper explains a use case of successful mobile-cloud integration with HMI panels. It also captures statistics on different behavioral characteristics observed post integration with mobile and cloud. © 2015 IEEE.},

VISOR is not intended to fit in a specific cloud framework but rather to overreach sharing and interoperability limitations among different frameworks. Such feature is achieved by relying on a flexible image metadata schema and in a storage abstraction layer, where the latter seamlessly abstracts the heterogeneity of distinct cloud storage systems into which images can be saved. VISOR is an open source highly distributed system composed of several independent web services. In its development we have focused in modularity, extensibility and performance. Conducted evaluation tests have shown encouraging results regarding performance and scalability. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Software is playing an increasing role in engineering, both to aid engineering and collaboration, as projects increase in complexity and diversity. Bentley Systems experienced 100% increase in terms of the revenue associated with the sale and delivery of offshore software. Bentley Systems also bought MOSES analysis software just over a year ago, a suite of analysis software for the installation of offshore structures and the design of all types of floating offshore systems. It provides hydrostatic and hydrodynamic analysis, used by the likes of Dockwise for floatover projects. MOSES brings additional capability to Bentley's existing range of products, which includes flagship product, SACS, an integrated suite of software for structural analysis and design of offshore structures, including oil, gas, and wind farm platforms and topsides. n addition to MOSES and SACS, Bentley also has a vessel design system called MAXSURF for the initial hull design of new vessels and review of stability for modifications to existing vessels. Having SACS and MOSES in the same company has lead to enhanced interoperability. There are plans for the future to create i-models automatically, and for increasing use of cloud computing. I-models are a medium for information exchange within projects associated with the lifecycle of infrastructure assets.},

abstract={Public transport systems already encounter vast amounts of data per day, ranging from the GPS information of vehicles to sensor checks on real-time locations. Newer technologies such as social media, sensor networks or passenger counting systems, to name just a few, present new opportunities as well as new challenges to accommodate even larger data volumes, essentially leading to a big data problem in the context of real-time distributed transport systems. We argue that contemporary models for such systems are inadequate or less than adequate in meeting these new challenges. In this paper we present a new cloud-based model for integrated, distributed public transport systems to enable greater flexibility, portability, and interoperability for different controllers and sensors. Our model is called MOVIE, an acronym for 'Model Operations View Intelligence Events'. The proposed MOVIE model describes an event controlled system which incorporates the cloud and various messaging protocols in order to provide a safe and secure way of communication between the users, sensors and the multimodal transportation network. We describe our new model in some detail and then present a simulation of a passenger counting system to deliver up to the minute information for passengers, to enable them to make more informed choices about their travel options. With the emergence of social media, public transport patrons may connect with transport systems in cities to receive and provide updates of the status of the traffic at that time. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile phone users are demanding an efficient convergent communication approach for efficient communication and information sharing with their real life social circles. Unfortunately, the existing telecom services and the popular Internet services are not organically integrated to provide convenient convergent services. To overcome this issue, one of the promising convergent communication services considered by telecom carriers is RCS (Rich Communication Suite). However, existing issues, such as insufficient interoperability among different operators, shortage of terminals and heavy dependence on large-scale IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) network deployment, mean that it will take time to implement RCS across worldwide networks and for it to become a service equally universal as voice and short message. Instead of a heavyweight RCS solution, in this paper, we propose a lightweight, quick deployment mobile phone book application system based on cloud computing without a fully deployed IP multimedia subsystem infrastructure, which seamlessly integrates traditional telecommunication services, instant messaging services, social networking services and automatic contact information management. Based on this, 'Telco-OTT' service provision approach, telecom carriers can allow their subscribers to enjoy conveniently the rich convergent personal service experience quickly without a large initial investment. Thus, it is a low-risk opportunity for telecom carriers to meet subscriber demand for advanced user-centric convergent service features. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) standard by OGF has become widely adopted in various cloud environments, such as the EGI Federated Cloud. It is currently supported by mainstream open source cloud management frameworks, e.g., OpenStack (through OCCI-OS) or OpenNebula (rOCCI) as well as others, less wide-spread ones. It is likewise supported by many workflow and submission tools used by user communities - VMDIRAC, JSAGA or SixSq. SlipStream to name but a few. OCCI is, however, found somewhat lacking in the availability of general-purpose clients supporting the standard. Only recently, its use was enabled only in the Ruby programming language through the rOCCI Framework, and command-line/scripting use was facilitated by the rOCCI-cli client. Naturally, there has been long-standing demand for OCCI support in other programming languages, primarily in Java. It has now been answered by the introduction of jOCCI -A native Java library implementing the OCCI class structure, rendering and transport specifications, currently in accordance with the OCCI v. 1.1 specification. Provided by the same product team already producing the rOCCI framework, it is more than "just another feature in the cloudscape." Rather than a simple translation of the client part of rOCCI, it is a brand new product -A choice that has been made not only to make it a truly native Java library, but also to introduce additional, independent, client to validate the generic functionality of existing OCCI server applications. This work describes the new library and compares it to rOCCI in terms of design and interoperability when used against other server-side OCCI implementations. It also discusses the relative merits of implementing the client library as a fresh product, relatively separate from rOCCI, rather than just providing Java bindings for the client side of the rOCCI Framework. Finally, the future of rOCCI and jOCCI is briefly discussed in view of the emerging OCCI v. 1.2 specification.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaping to a worldwide network of networks consisting of billions of interconnected heterogeneous sensor/actuator-equipped devices (denoted as “things” or “smart objects”), which are expected to exceed 50 billions by 2020. Smart objects, which will be pervasively deployed, are constrained devices with (i) limited processing power and available memory and (ii) limited communication capabilities, in terms of transmission rate and reliability. Future Smart-X applications, such as Smart Cities and Home Automation, will be fostered by the use of standard and interoperable IP-based communication protocols that smart objects are going to implement, by simplifying their development, integration, and deployment. Smart-X applications will significantly differ from traditional Internet services, in terms of: (i) the number of data sources; (ii) rate of information exchange; and, (iii) need for real-time processing. Because of these requirements, such services are denoted as “Big Stream” applications, in order to distinguish them from traditional Big Data applications. In this paper, we present an implementation of a novel Cloud architecture for Big Stream applications based on standard protocols and open-source components, which provides a scalable and efficient processing platform for IoT applications, designed to be open and extensible and to guarantee minimal latency between data generation and consumption. We also provide a performance evaluation based on experimentation in a real-world Smart Parking scenario, to assess the feasibility and scalability of the proposed architecture. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={This paper aimed to design and develop a Big Data architecture in which Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASN) are integrated with Web Services for ubiquitous healthcare service. The WBASN are envisioned as comprising heterogeneous sensors and devices assisting to a large range of health care applications. Interoperability is required for such heterogeneous sensors and devices. To achieve this, Service Oriented approach for the data access from WBASN is proposed. The data access from WBASN is done in which body sensor nodes are service providers and medical applications are clients of such services. The service oriented architecture for WBASN has been realized that for each precise requisite of the medical application, here the physician, the services of the body sensors are invoked through a medical registry. Here, several body sensors are networked together to monitor different health parameters to form a star topology and they have been integrated with Internet by registering them as services. The WBASN is extended to cloud architecture in which this SOA enabled – networked body sensors are deployed into a public Cloud. As cloud resources facilitate the WBASN to accumulate and investigate their immense total of data, Body Sensor Cloud is deliberated using Service Oriented Body Area Sensor Network Architecture. Body Sensor Cloud acts as a facilitator for Big sensor Data analytics. Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) perception is used to store the body sensor data on to body sensor cloud and MapReduce technique is planned for analysis of the intended data. The proposed work acts as a smart health care architectural system to analyze and access the body sensor data with converging technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks, Cloud computing and Big Data analytics. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Objectives: The aim of this article is to present the preliminary impact of a medication monitoring program, PharmaCloud, in Taiwan and analyze the embedded factors that have contributed to the performance thereof. This article also compared PharmaCloud with similar international programs in order to draw lessons learned. Methods: The five domains of the RE-AIM framework - reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance - were examined using qualitative and quantitative data. A difference-in-differences model was applied to analyze the quantitative impact of PharmaCloud on drug utilization and drug expenses. The qualitative impact was evaluated by document analysis based on field reports from the participating medical institutions. Results: Reach and adoption: although all of the major hospitals adopted PharmaCloud and some of the hospitals had high inquiry rates, more time and incentives are needed to raise the overall inquiry rate. Effectiveness: during the study period of 3 months, the number of medications per prescription declined in the intervention group was 0.15 more than that of the general population, and the drug expense per person declined in the intervention group was NT $567 (US $18.9) more than that of the general population. The potential savings could be between 2% and 5% of the total pharmaceutical expenditure. Medication duplication was found to have decreased more in the intervention group. Implementation: a variety of innovations in care delivery are being developed in which the pharmacists play a more significant role. Maintenance: the embedded National Health Insurance would lend strong support for PharmaCloud to grow and thrive. Conclusion: PharmaCloud owes its effectiveness to the embedded National Health Insurance (NHI) program, which is universal and provides a comprehensive benefit package including more than 16,000 prescription drugs. An effective medication program is one that operates under the principle of universality and comprehensiveness, facilitates innovations, and has a substantial level of interoperability with the intra-hospital health information systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Cloud computing has become fundamental technologies for most of IT-services today. This is due to primarily to its elastic nature: users or customers can acquire and release resources on-demand, and pay only for the resources they need (pay-per-use or pay-asyou-go model). Although the number and quality of cloud services are daily rising, but on the other aspect, the user requirements for the services also increase very fast and diversely. One of the prominent user demands is the need of a solution that can help them automatically choose suitable resources to deploy appliances into cloud environment. Based on the previous work presented in [1], in this paper, we go further to develop a primitive semantic model of cloud resources derived from multiinfrastructures. This semantic model allows users to create service and automatically deploy them to suitable cloud according to specific requirements of each. In this way, the approach enables appliance interoperability and elasticity among clouds. Our solution thus achieves value-added feature for cloud providers and simultaneously lowers barriers for users when using cloud computing. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={One of the main advantages of the cloud computing paradigm is that it simplifies the time-consuming processes of hardware provisioning, hardware procurement and software deployment. Currently, we are witnessing a proliferation in the number of cloud-hosted applications. However, one of the important challenges of the cloud computing paradigm that may hurt the growth of this technology is the interoperability and portability between cloud platforms. The developers and cloud users may lock-in to the first cloud they choose, or face difficulties when they have to move their data or software from one cloud platform to another. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of data portability between different cloud-based data storage services. In particular, we propose a common data model and a standardized API for the new generation of cloud-based NoSQL databases. The initial implementation of our framework covers three of the most popular NoSQL systems, namely, Google Datastore, Amazon SimpleDB and MongoDB. However, our framework is designed in a flexible way that it can be easily extended to support other NoSQL systems. Furthermore, our framework is equipped with tools that support the conversion, transformation and exchange of the data which is stored on the supported NoSQL databases of the framework. Finally, we describe the design and the proof-of-concept implementation of our framework using a case study. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Nowadays, more and more organizations and industries are planning to move to cloud considering the advantages such as reduced cost and dynamic scalability. However, there are some hindering issues such as low interoperability, security and service level. Specially, lacking in cloud interoperability, customers may lock in to a specific cloud service provider, not being able to take economic advantage and service quality improvement by moving to a different provider later. In this paper, we dig into cloud computing interoperability requirements from four different aspects. They are VM image migration, data movement, resource/job management and user permission/authorization management. Before deriving the interoperability requirements, we developed specific use-cases first, and then derived the requirements based on the use-cases. The derived requirements will contribute to improve cloud interoperability dramatically when they are reflected in international standard, and our work is a part of this effort. © 2014 International Information Institute.},

abstract={An emerging hyper-world encompasses all human activities in a social-cyber-physical space. Its power derives from the Wisdom Web of Things (W2T) cycle, namely, 'from things to data, information, knowledge, wisdom, services, humans, and then back to things.'' The W2T cycle leads to a harmonious symbiosis among humans, computers, and things, which can be constructed by large-scale converging of intelligent information technology applications with an open and interoperable architecture. The recent advances in cloud computing, the Internet of Things, Web of Things, Big Data, and other research fields have provided just such an open system architecture with resource sharing and services. The next step is to develop an open and interoperable content architecture with intelligent sharing and services for the organization and transformation in the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy. This article introduces wisdom as a service (WaaS), a content architecture based on the pay-as-you-go IT trend. The WaaS infrastructure and the main challenges in WaaS research and applications are discussed. A case study is also described. Relying on cloud computing and big data, WaaS provides a practical approach to realize the W2T cycle in the hyper-world for the coming age of ubiquitous intelligent IT applications. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Soil moisture plays a significant role in both water and energy cycles. It is important to manage and analyze in situ sensor observations of soil moisture due to its impacts on agricultural and hydrological processes. Google Fusion Tables (GFT) is a cloud computing database that provides a service on the Web for data management and integration. Using GFT for managing soil moisture sensor observations, it is possible to take advantages of GFT for collaborative management, on-the-fly visualization, and flexible integration and analysis. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) sensor observation service (SOS) can provide real-time or near-real-time observations in an interoperable way. Combing SOS and GFT together can take the best of both. The paper investigates how GFT could be employed for managing, visualizing, and analyzing soil moisture sensor observations. It describes the design and implementation of a cloud-based SOS for managing soil moisture data using cloud computing databases. By storing sensor observations in GFT, the SOS service is scalable, and observations can be visualized and analyzed on demand. Challenges and approaches on the integration of GFT and SOS are discussed. A prototype service on sharing and managing soil moisture sensor observations is developed to demonstrate the applicability of the approach. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

An empirical test on undergraduate and graduate students shows that of these antecedents a person's attitude toward cloud computing, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and perceived usefulness have direct impacts on intentions, while other antecedents, including perceived ease of use, transferability of computer skills, vendor reputation, perceived risks, privacy concerns, security concerns, and concerns about vendor lock-in, have indirect impacts. The study expands the view on cloud computing adoption among individual users with a multiplicity of factors and an integrative framework, and it also highlights the tradeoffs between benefits and risks in adoption decisions. © 2015, IGI Global.

However, in order to realize mobile cloud computing, we need to develop mechanisms to achieve interoperability among heterogeneous and distributed devices. We need solutions to discover best available resources in the cloud servers based on the user demands and approaches to deliver desired resources and services efficiently and in a timely fashion to the mobile terminals. Furthermore, while mobile cloud computing has tremendous potential to enable the mobile terminals to have access to powerful and reliable computing resources anywhere and anytime, we must consider several issues including privacy and security, and reliability in realizing mobile cloud computing. In this chapter, the authors first explore the architectural components required to realize a mobile cloud computing infrastructure. They then discuss mobile cloud computing features with their unique privacy and security implications. They present unique issues of mobile cloud computing that exacerbate privacy and security challenges. They also discuss various approaches to address these challenges and explore the future work needed to provide a trustworthy mobile cloud computing environment. © 2015 by IGI Global.

abstract={Cloud computing transforms the way Information Technology (IT) is consumed and managed, promising improved cost efficiencies, accelerated innovation, faster time-to-market, and the ability to scale applications on demand (Leighton, 2009). According to Gartner, while the hype grew exponentially during 2008 and continued since, it is clear that there is a major shift towards the cloud computing model and that the benefits may be substantial (Gartner Hype-Cycle, 2012). However, as the shape of cloud computing is emerging and developing rapidly both conceptually and in reality, the legal/contractual, economic, service quality, interoperability, security, and privacy issues still pose significant challenges. In this chapter, the authors describe various service and deployment models of cloud computing and identify major challenges. In particular, they discuss three critical challenges: regulatory, security, and privacy issues in cloud computing. Some solutions to mitigate these challenges are also proposed along with a brief presentation on the future trends in cloud computing deployment. © 2015 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cloud Computing as a service-on-demand architecture has grown in importance over the previous few years. One driver of its growth is the ever-increasing amount of data that is supposed to outpace the growth of storage capacity. The usage of cloud technology enables organizations to manage their data with low operational expenses. However, the benefits of cloud computing come along with challenges and open issues such as security, reliability, and the risk to become dependent on a provider for its service. In general, a switch of a storage provider is associated with high costs of adapting new APIs and additional charges for inbound and outbound bandwidth and requests. In this chapter, the authors present a system that improves availability, confidentiality, and reliability of data stored in the cloud. To achieve this objective, the authors encrypt users' data and make use of the RAID-technology principle to manage data distribution across cloud storage providers. Further, they discuss the security functionality and present a proof-of-concept experiment for the application to evaluate the performance and cost effectiveness of the approach. The authors deploy the application using eight commercial cloud storage repositories in different countries. The approach allows users to avoid vendor lock-in and reduces significantly the cost of switching providers. They also observe that the implementation improved the perceived availability and, in most cases, the overall performance when compared with individual cloud providers. Moreover, the authors estimate the monetary costs to be competitive to the cost of using a single cloud provider. © 2015 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is the most promising computing paradigm that provides flexible resource allocation on demand with the promise of realizing elastic, Internet-accessible, computing on a pay-as-you-go basis. With the growth and expansion of the Cloud services and participation of various services providers, the description of quality parameters and measurement units start to diversify and sometime contradict. Such ambiguity does not only result in the rise of various Quality of Service (QoS) interoperability problems but also in the distraction of the services consumers who find themselves unable to match quality requirements with the providers' offerings. Yet, employing the available QoS models that cover certain quality aspects while neglecting others drive consumers to perform their service selection based only on cost-benefit analysis and performance evaluation, without being able to perform subjective selection based on a comprehensive set of well-defined quality aspects. This chapter presents a novel QoS ontology that combines and defines all of the existing quality aspects in a unified way to efficiently overcome all existing diversities. Using such an ontology, a comprehensive broad QoS model combining all quality-related parameters of both service providers and consumers for different Cloud platforms is presented. The chapter also provides a mathematical model that formulates the Cloud Computing service provider selection optimization problem based on QoS guarantees. The validation of the provided model is addressed in the chapter through extensive simulation studies conducted on benchmark data of Content Delivery Network providers. The studies report the efficient matching of the model with the market-oriented different platform characteristics. © 2015 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

In addition, illness has become more complex while advancement in technology and research have expedited the rise of modern and more effective diagnoses and treatment techniques. Cloud computing allows healthcare professionals to share medical records, including all sorts of image and accuracy while new applications or workloads can be started much faster, without going through the entire procurement process or testing the interoperability of the entire infrastructure. Moreover, although the notion of organizational culture is now routinely invoked in organizations and management literature, it remains an elusive concept. However, it is clear that managing the culture is one path towards improving healthcare, and cloud computing introduces a dynamic system adaptation, affecting the quality of care.

abstract={From birth to death, every human being leaves a long medical history consisting of laboratory exams, records of medical consultations, records, and hospitalizations, as well as any other important information that affects the patient's health. These are known today as Electronic Health Records (EHR) or Electronic Medical Records (EMR). However, because a person's lifestyle and health are continuously changing, most of this medical information is distributed among different institutions, cities, and even countries where the specific processes were undertaken, in possession of health insurance providers or even hidden inside a drawer of the patient's home. Therefore, aiming to enhance the availability of improved medical services at reduced costs, modern information technology is being increasingly used in the healthcare sector. Researchers, developers, and companies have made efforts to develop mobile, Web, desktop, and enterprise e-health applications raising the importance of interoperability and data exchange between e-health applications and Health Information Systems (HIS). In this regard, Cloud Computing (CC) promises low cost, high scalability, availability, and disaster recoverability, which can be a natural solution for some of the problems faced in storing and analyzing EMRs. However, CC, which is mainly defined to address the use of scalable and often virtualized resources, is still evolving. New, specific collaboration models among service providers are needed for enabling effective service collaboration, allowing the process of serving consumers to be more efficient. In this chapter, the current state and trends of CC in healthcare are presented as well as a detailed collaboration model based on intelligent agents focusing on the EHR sharing subject. This model for enabling effective service in cloud systems is based on a recent research proposal related to defining a collaboration mechanism by means of Scout Movement. The chapter also includes details on the way in which services and service providers are clearly defined in this particular system. © 2015 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The proliferation of Cloud Computing platforms has led to the emergence of a large number of heterogeneous platform resources, services, application programming interfaces and supported frameworks and technologies. On one hand, supported frameworks vary from one Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to another depending on their implementations and capacities. On the other hand, each PaaS provides a specific and proprietary scenario to provision adequate resources and to deploy applications. In this paper, we propose a new PaaS-independent approach to provision in a unified way, appropriate PaaS resources for applications deployment in Cloud platforms. Our approach aims at addressing vendor lock-in restrictions and applications portability issues in existing Cloud platforms. To that end, we define a unified description model based on the Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) core model that allows describing and managing an abstract Cloud resource. Our defined model consists of two main parts: (1) an OCCI platform extension which describes PaaS resources that can be provisioned by a PaaS to set-up an appropriate environment and (2) an OCCI application extension which describes application resources to deploy an application in this environment. We show the feasibility of our approach with an implementation and a use case of a realistic deployment scenario in Cloud Foundry PaaS. © 2014 The British Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In cloud computing environments in software as a service (SaaS) level, interoperability refers to the ability of SaaS systems on one cloud provider to communicate with SaaS systems on another cloud provider. One of the most important barriers to the adoption of SaaS systems in cloud computing environments is interoperability. A common tactic for enabling interoperability is the use of an interoperability framework or model. During the past few years, in cloud SaaS level, various interoperability frameworks and models have been developed to provide interoperability between systems. The syntactic interoperability of SaaS systems have already been intensively researched. However, not enough consideration has been given to semantic interoperability issues. Achieving semantic interoperability is a challenge within the world of SaaS in cloud computing environments. Therefore, a semantic interoperability framework for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments is needed. We develop a semantic interoperability framework for cloud SaaS systems. The capabilities and value of service oriented architecture for semantic interoperability within cloud SaaS systems have been studied and demonstrated. This paper is accomplished through a number of steps (research methodology). It begins with a study on related works in the literature. Then, problem statement and research objectives are explained. In the next step, semantic interoperability requirements for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments that are needed to support are analyzed. The details of the proposed semantic interoperability framework for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments are presented. It includes the design of the proposed semantic interoperability framework. Finally, the evaluation methods of the semantic interoperability framework are elaborated. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic interoperability framework for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments, extensive experimentation and statistical analysis have been performed. The experiments and statistical analysis specify that the proposed semantic interoperability framework for cloud SaaS systems is able to establish semantic interoperability between cloud SaaS systems in a more efficient way. It is concluded that using the proposed framework, there is a significant improvement in the effectiveness of semantic interoperability of SaaS systems in cloud computing environments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Web services promise universal interoperability through integration of services developed by independent providers. The coming of the Cloud Computing paradigm extends the need to share resources (e.g., platform, infrastructure, data) that are accessible as Web services. This means that a key factor to build complex and valuable business processes among cooperating organizations relies on the efficiency of automate the discovering of appropriate Web services. The increasing availability of Web services that offer similar functionalities requires mechanisms to go beyond the pure functional discovery. This chapter proposes the evaluation of Web service contracts, which define non-functional properties (NFPs) and applicability conditions associated with Web services, as a solution to automate process composition and enactment. Today, there is a lack of tools and algorithms that fully support this solution due to several open issues. First, existing languages don't provide the right constructs for the specification of Web service contracts. Second, the lack of standard languages determines heterogeneity in Web service contract specifications raising interoperability issues. Third, Web service contract evaluation is only partially supported by existing discovery engines and composition tools when combining different services from different providers. This chapter proposes some research efforts on addressing these open issues. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014. All rights are reserved.},

abstract={With Cloud Computing there comes new possibilities like programmability of Infrastructure via provider exposed APIs. These APIs can aid the concept of elasticity that is associated with the Cloud however, there is a trend that these APIs are provider specific in the abstract of functionality and interface. There are yet no governing standards for the provision of Cloud APIs. One method to overcome this lack of standards is Open APIs like Clouds and Cloudify. This paper reviews literature and proposes eight criteria and fifty-five sub-criteria that can be used to evaluate Clouds and Cloudify. The evaluation will be performed on the creation of a web service based cloud console prototype with these APIs as demonstration of the most common type of Cloud Application, a Web application. This paper will propose that the use of Open APIs enhances or enables forty-eight of the sub-criteria and potentially diminishes one sub-criteria which is security related. This paper also proposes that lack of inclusion of billing APIs in Cloud Provider API offering is an area of omission. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing as a service-on-demand architecture has grown in importance over the previous few years. One driver of its growth is the ever-increasing amount of data that is supposed to outpace the growth of storage capacity. The usage of cloud technology enables organizations to manage their data with low operational expenses. However, the benefits of cloud computing come along with challenges and open issues such as security, reliability, and the risk to become dependent on a provider for its service. In general, a switch of a storage provider is associated with high costs of adapting new APIs and additional charges for inbound and outbound bandwidth and requests. In this chapter, the authors present a system that improves availability, confidentiality, and reliability of data stored in the cloud. To achieve this objective, the authors encrypt users' data and make use of the RAID-technology principle to manage data distribution across cloud storage providers. Further, they discuss the security functionality and present a proof-of-concept experiment for the application to evaluate the performance and cost effectiveness of the approach. The authors deploy the application using eight commercial cloud storage repositories in different countries. The approach allows users to avoid vendor lock-in and reduces significantly the cost of switching providers. They also observe that the implementation improved the perceived availability and, in most cases, the overall performance when compared with individual cloud providers. Moreover, the authors estimate the monetary costs to be competitive to the cost of using a single cloud provider. © 2014, IGI Global.},

In addition, illness has become more complex while advancement in technology and research have expedited the rise of modern and more effective diagnoses and treatment techniques. Cloud computing allows healthcare professionals to share medical records, including all sorts of image and accuracy while new applications or workloads can be started much faster, without going through the entire procurement process or testing the interoperability of the entire infrastructure. Moreover, although the notion of organizational culture is now routinely invoked in organizations and management literature, it remains an elusive concept. However, it is clear that managing the culture is one path towards improving healthcare, and cloud computing introduces a dynamic system adaptation, affecting the quality of care.

abstract={Cloud computing is a promising computing paradigm wherein computational resources such as processors, storage, and software applications are provided as services to the clients over high bandwidth networks. The diverse software services (SaaS) in a Cloud may not exist in isolation; they require interaction with each other in order to accomplish tasks. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) enables applications to be designed and developed as a collection of services, each accessible through well-defined interfaces specified for the purpose. Since SOA inherently fosters interoperability, it would enhance the integration and interaction among the Cloud software services. However, hardware and software technologies are constantly evolving at a tremendous pace and technology obsolescence is a major challenge to the software industry. Consequently, a software development approach that could alleviate the undesirable effects of technology shifts is desirable. In this perspective, the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) becomes a preferred methodology for developing software applications. This chapter proposes to integrate the three paradigms, namely Cloud computing, SOA, and MDA, to yield Cloud software services that are robust, flexible, and agile. Convergence of SOA and MDA paradigms in the development of Cloud software services will provide an apt solution to technology obsolescence. © 2014, IGI Global.},

abstract={From birth to death, every human being leaves a long medical history consisting of laboratory exams, records of medical consultations, records, and hospitalizations, as well as any other important information that affects the patient's health. These are known today as Electronic Health Records (EHR) or Electronic Medical Records (EMR). However, because a person's lifestyle and health are continuously changing, most of this medical information is distributed among different institutions, cities, and even countries where the specific processes were undertaken, in possession of health insurance providers or even hidden inside a drawer of the patient's home. Therefore, aiming to enhance the availability of improved medical services at reduced costs, modern information technology is being increasingly used in the healthcare sector. Researchers, developers, and companies have made efforts to develop mobile, Web, desktop, and enterprise e-health applications raising the importance of interoperability and data exchange between e-health applications and Health Information Systems (HIS). In this regard, Cloud Computing (CC) promises low cost, high scalability, availability, and disaster recoverability, which can be a natural solution for some of the problems faced in storing and analyzing EMRs. However, CC, which is mainly defined to address the use of scalable and often virtualized resources, is still evolving. New, specific collaboration models among service providers are needed for enabling effective service collaboration, allowing the process of serving consumers to be more efficient. In this chapter, the current state and trends of CC in healthcare are presented as well as a detailed collaboration model based on intelligent agents focusing on the EHR sharing subject. This model for enabling effective service in cloud systems is based on a recent research proposal related to defining a collaboration mechanism by means of Scout Movement. The chapter also includes details on the way in which services and service providers are clearly defined in this particular system. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platform (CBRAIN) is a web-based collaborative research platform developed in response to t the challenges raised by data-heavy, compute-intensive neuroimaging research. CBRAIN offers transparent access to remote data sources, distributed computing sites, and an array of processing and visualization tools with in a controlled, secure environment. Its web interface is accessible through any modern browser and uses graphical interface idioms to reduce the technical expertise required to perform large-scale computational analyses. CBRAIN's flexible meta-scheduling has allowed the incorporation of a wide range of heterogeneous computing sites, currently including nine national research High Performance Computing (HPC) centers in Canada, one in Korea, one in Germany, and several local research servers. CBRAIN leverages remote computing cycles and facilitates resource-interoperability in a transparent manner for the end-user. Compared with typical grid solutions available, our architecture was designed to be easily extendable and deployed on existing remote computing sites with no tool modification, administrative intervention, or special softwarehhardware configuration. As October 2013, CBRAIN serves over 200 users spread across 53 cities in 17 countries. The platform is built as a generic framework that can accept data and analysis tools from any discipline. However, its current focus is primarily on neuroimaging research and studies of neurological diseases such as Autism, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, Multiple Sclerosis as well as on normal brain structure and development.

abstract={Cloud Computing is the most promising computing paradigm that provides flexible resource allocation on demand with the promise of realizing elastic, Internet-accessible, computing on a pay-as-you-go basis. With the growth and expansion of the Cloud services and participation of various services providers, the description of quality parameters and measurement units start to diversify and sometime contradict. Such ambiguity does not only result in the rise of various Quality of Service (QoS) interoperability problems but also in the distraction of the services consumers who find themselves unable to match quality requirements with the providers' offerings. Yet, employing the available QoS models that cover certain quality aspects while neglecting others drive consumers to perform their service selection based only on cost-benefit analysis and performance evaluation, without being able to perform subjective selection based on a comprehensive set of well-defined quality aspects. This chapter presents a novel QoS ontology that combines and defines all of the existing quality aspects in a unified way to efficiently overcome all existing diversities. Using such an ontology, a comprehensive broad QoS model combining all quality-related parameters of both service providers and consumers for different Cloud platforms is presented. The chapter also provides a mathematical model that formulates the Cloud Computing service provider selection optimization problem based on QoS guarantees. The validation of the provided model is addressed in the chapter through extensive simulation studies conducted on benchmark data of Content Delivery Network providers. The studies report the efficient matching of the model with the market-oriented different platform characteristics. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Starting with the provision of ready-to-use infrastructures, such as storage and compute resources, cloud computing quickly became a flexible, cost-effective and complete environment for a wide range of IT services offered over the Internet. A growing number of cloud providers started to expose their own services to the market, to answer consumer's need, engaging a competition in the attempt to offer the easiest access to resources and the wider catalogue of services. Being integrated with proprietary services and infrastructures, these offerings makes difficult to switch between different underlying technologies, so that the customer is tied to the service provider's strategy. This lack in standards interfaces, service requirements and technologies brings into the cloud the vendor lock-in problem. Due to this complex scenery, a categorization of services to support the choice of the right solution, as well as a semantic and computable description of services that enables the comparison and the mapping between different providers' services, proves to be extremely appealing. In an attempt to take a first important step in this context we propose the semantic description of some cloud services, exposing them in terms of functionalities, parameters exchanged, and collaboration between services. In particular in this paper we present the semantic representation of Microsoft Windows Azure APIs, describing functional and non-functional properties of the services. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The distributed and complexity nature of modern critical infrastructures that have to provide integrated services through the interoperability of heterogeneous subsystems, even spread among different countries, require new methodologies and tools to dominate overall systems complexity. In particular, in order to get knowledge about their real behavior and define dependability improvement actions, such complex and distributed systems should be reproduced and simulated locally. On the other hand, the extraordinary large number of their components cause a large-scale of the resulting model, limiting its resolution by current simulators. This paper presents a framework to implement hybrid simulation of distributed large-scale critical infrastructures, such as Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Vessel Traffic System (VTS). High Level Architecture (HLA) has been introduced into the engine simulations platform as its design and development foundation, whereas cloud-based virtualization techniques have been exploited in order to reproduce the overall distributed system on a local adaptive testbed. The use of such a framework can result in a considerable reduction of costs in all the system life phases, as well as an increased system dependability level. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The unabated flurry of research activities to augment various mobile devices by leveraging heterogeneous cloud resources has created a new research domain called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). In the core of such a non-uniform environment, facilitating interoperability, portability, and integration among heterogeneous platforms is nontrivial. Building such facilitators in MCC requires investigations to understand heterogeneity and its challenges over the roots. Although there are many research studies in mobile computing and cloud computing, convergence of these two areas grants further academic efforts towards flourishing MCC. In this paper, we define MCC, explain its major challenges, discuss heterogeneity in convergent computing (i.e. mobile computing and cloud computing) and networking (wired and wireless networks), and divide it into two dimensions, namely vertical and horizontal. Heterogeneity roots are analyzed and taxonomized as hardware, platform, feature, API, and network. Multidimensional heterogeneity in MCC results in application and code fragmentation problems that impede development of cross-platform mobile applications which is mathematically described. The impacts of heterogeneity in MCC are investigated, related opportunities and challenges are identified, and predominant heterogeneity handling approaches like virtualization, middleware, and service oriented architecture (SOA) are discussed. We outline open issues that help in identifying new research directions in MCC. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a newly emerged computing infrastructure that builds on the latest achievements of diverse research areas, such as Grid computing, Service-oriented computing, business process management and virtualization. An important characteristic of Cloud-based services is the provision of non-functional guarantees in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), such as guarantees on execution time or price. However, due to system malfunctions, changing workload conditions, hard- and software failures, established SLAs can be violated. In order to avoid costly SLA violations, flexible and adaptive SLA attainment strategies are needed. In this paper we present a self-manageable architecture for SLA-based service virtualization that provides a way to ease interoperable service executions in a diverse, heterogeneous, distributed and virtualized world of services. We demonstrate in this paper that the combination of negotiation, brokering and deployment using SLA-aware extensions and autonomic computing principles are required for achieving reliable and efficient service operation in distributed environments. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Cloud Computing and Service Oriented Architectures have seen a dramatic increase of the amount of applications, services, management platforms, data, etc. gaining momentum for the necessity of new complex methods and techniques to deal with the vast heterogeneity of data sources or services. In this sense Quality of Service (QoS) seeks for providing an intelligent environment of self-management components based on domain knowledge in which cloud components can be optimized easing the transition to an advanced governance environment. On the other hand, semantics and ontologies have emerged to afford a common and standard data model that eases the interoperability, integration and monitoring of knowledge-based systems. Taking into account the necessity of an interoperable and intelligent system to manage QoS in cloud-based systems and the emerging application of semantics in different domains, this paper reviews the main approaches for semantic-based QoS management as well as the principal methods, techniques and standards for processing and exploiting diverse data providing advanced real-time monitoring services. A semantic-based framework for QoS management is also outlined taking advantage of semantic technologies and distributed datastream processing techniques. Finally a discussion of existing efforts and challenges is also provided to suggest future directions.©2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With the increasing user demand for elastic provisioning of resources coupled with ubiquitous and on-demand access to data, cloud computing has been recognized as an emerging technology to meet such dynamic user demands. In addition, with the introduction and rising use of mobile devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received considerable attention since the IoT has brought physical devices and connected them to the Internet, enabling each device to share data with surrounding devices and virtualized technologies in real-time. Consequently, the exploding data usage requires a new, innovative computing platform that can provide robust real-time data analytics and resource provisioning to clients. As a result, fog computing has recently been introduced to provide computation, storage and networking services between the end-users and traditional cloud computing data centers. This paper proposes a policy-based management of resources in fog computing, expanding the current fog computing platform to support secure collaboration and interoperability between different user-requested resources in fog computing. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is a new technology that has rapidly established itself in computer science since it allows the usage of huge computing resources that are dynamically allocated in order to satisfy user's needs and that are accessible as a service through a remote interface, such as a web browser. Cloud resources can be distributed in different places and such distribution is made transparent to the user; this one does not need to worry about data replication and/or maintenance of the infrastructure but he/she benefits only of the required services, by exploiting the Pay-Per-Use business model. In this context, the interoperability among different providers becomes critical due to the vendor lock-in problem. Here we present a multi agent system that accesses, on behalf of the user, the utility market of Cloud computing to maintain the best resources configuration that satisfies the application requirements. It also offers management and monitoring facilities for the Cloud infrastructure in order to guide the user in all the phases of the application's lifecycle. Together with the platform, we present client-side tools that can be used to orchestrate agents' based services.},

abstract={Services are expected to be a promising way for people to use information and computing resources in our emerging ubiquitous network society and cloud computing environments. In this study, we propose a metaphoric concept called a flowable service. It is defined as a logical stream that organizes and provides circumjacent services in such a way that they are perceived by individuals to be naturally embedded in their surrounding environments. We present our view on how some of these problems, such as the flexibility, portability and interoperability of services, can be solved using flowable services in order to provide a seamless integration of diverse services in the most intuitive "flowable" way possible, thus achieving maximum satisfaction for both service providers and consumers while decreasing the delivery cost of the services. Recognizing the importance of the awareness of each individual's context for a smooth and accurate provision of services, we further propose a human-centric framework for context-aware flowable services, which harnesses the users' contexts to enable a pro-active support of human activities in a flexible and natural way. Owing to context-awareness, this framework can find and integrate circumjacent services that are considered needed by each individual and can create an ambient service environment that is tailored to his/her specific needs, proclivities and characteristics. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

By applying, on the fly, composite geospatial processes on the above data it is possible to produce valuable geoinformation over the web directly available and applicable to a wide range of geo-activities of significant importance for the research and industry community. Cloud computing may enable geospatial processing since it refers to, among other things, efficient computing resources providing on demand processing services. In this context, we attempt to provide a design and architectural framework for web applications based on open geospatial standards. Our approach includes, in addition to geospatial processing, data acquisition services that are essential especially when dealing with satellite images and applications in the area of remote sensing and similar fields. As a result, by putting in a common framework all data and geoprocesses available in the Cloud, it is possible to combine the appropriate services in order to produce a solution for a specific need. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={The market of cloud computing encompasses an ever-growing number of cloud providers offering a multitude of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions. The heterogeneity of these solutions hinders the proper exploitation of cloud computing since it prevents interoperability and promotes vendor lock-in, which increases the complexity of executing and managing multi-cloud applications (i.e., Applications that can be deployed across multiple cloud infrastructures and platforms). Providers of multi-cloud applications seek to exploit the peculiarities of each cloud solution and to combine the delivery models of IaaS and PaaS in order to optimise performance, availability, and cost. In this paper, we show how the Cloud Modelling Framework leverages upon model-driven engineering to tame this complexity by providing: (i) a tool-supported domain-specific language for specifying the provisioning and deployment of multi-cloud applications, and (ii) a models@run-time environment for enacting the provisioning, deployment, and adaptation of these applications. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In academia, many institutes have deployed IaaS cloud services in isolation, based on cloud management frameworks of their choice, making the cloudscape quite heterogeneous. Now, with the effort to federate cloud resources well underway, the challenge is not to make everyone switch to a common solution, but rather to allow everyone to keep their setup but still provide uniform access to essential services. This seems to be best achieved by implementing common standards. This paper discusses the different areas such standardization effort must address, ranging from the choice of the actual standardization approach (i.e., Choosing a recognized open standard or possibly a non-standard solution with a strong community backing) through authentication and virtual machine life-cycle management to monitoring or accounting (billing) services. The discussion is based on the authors' own practical experience with implementing standard compliance in multiple cloud management frameworks, producing a real-world interoperability solution - the rOCCI Framework - which is also introduced in the paper. © 2014 IEEE.},

Industrial EMS are complex and expensive systems due to the unique requirements of performance, reliability, and interoperability. Moreover, industry is facing challenges with current EMS implementations such as cross-site monitoring of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, integration between energy and production data, and meaningful energy efficiency benchmarking. Additionally, big data has emerged because of recent advances in field instrumentation that led to the generation of large quantities of machine data, with much more detail and higher sampling rates. This created a challenge for real-time analytics. In order to address all these needs and challenges, we propose a cloud-native industrial EMS solution with cloud computing capabilities.

abstract={Cloud computing is a service oriented concept which offers everything as a service. These services are deployed at the server with necessary credentials in order to provide reliable services to the customer. The customer always wants to process and store the data in the cloud with an efficient access over different location. The security is the key parameter to secure the customer's data. The cloud computing security issues are addressed in various standards and techniques which lacks in providing a complete solution. The privacy issues in the cloud access are handled and assessed by using privacy protocols and assessment techniques which are also addressed. The trust issues in cloud computing has been addressed with different models. An inter-cloud and intra-cloud standard of cloud interoperability has been identified in order to highlight the challenges exist during the cloud interaction. The cloud resources are deployed over cloud environment with different models also faces a problem. This paper focuses on a recent survey related to the cloud interoperability, security, privacy and trust based on standards and guidelines have been analyzed. The overall focus on this paper is to establish an interoperability among different cloud service providers for effective interaction by maximizing the QoS of cloud computing. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The broad diffusion of Cloud Computing has fostered the proliferation of a large number of cloud computing providers. The need of Cloud Brokers arises for helping consumers in discovering, considering and comparing services with different capabilities and offered by different providers. Also, consuming services exposed by different providers, when possible, may alleviate the vendor lock-in. While it can be straightforward to choose the best provider when deploying small and homogeneous applications, things get harder if the size and complexity of applications grow up. In this paper we propose a genetic approach for Cloud Brokering, focusing on finding Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) resources for satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of applications. We performed a set of experiments with an implementation of such broker. Results show that our broker can find near-optimal solutions even when dealing with hundreds of providers, trying at the same time to mitigate the vendor lock-in. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The deployment of applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environments avoids vendor lock-in and reliance on a single cloud provider. The virtual compute infrastructures of IaaS provides enables enterprises to build large scale, geographically distributed applications. Each IaaS provider offers virtual machines that can communicate with each other over a virtual network. However, each IaaS provider exposes subtle differences in the support for virtual machines, storage, networking, routing, etc. In this position paper we argue that configuration management is an enabler for multicloud environments by making abstraction of the above mentioned difierences in the IaaS platforms, through configuration management. We illustrate this claim by using configuration management to address the challenges associated with multi-cloud environments.},

abstract={The paradigm of Software as a Service (SaaS) offers an interesting option to vendors of simulation software for providing their applications to a wide circle of customers. However, this imposes a challenge to vendors whose applications exist only as classical desktop tools, so far: Interfaces for the remote control have to be provided which are as independent from the underlying cloud infrastructure as possible in order to avoid vendor lock-ins. We present an interoperable platform developed in the project Cloud4E (Trusted Cloud Computing for Engineering), which allows the provisioning of existing simulation software in form of a service in a cloud. The interoperability of the platform and of the services is achieved by the usage of the Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) together with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) where OCCI is not only used as interface to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) but also as interface to SaaS. Hence, the OCCI server plays a central role within the platform and can quickly become a bottleneck, which degrades the performance of the whole platform. We present detailed performance investigations and suggest options to improve the performance. The investigations were performed on the widely used OCCI server implementation called rOCCI server connected to the OpenNebula cloud middleware. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={This paper proposes and reports the development of an open source solution for the integrated management of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing resources, through the use of a common API taxonomy, to incorporate open source and proprietary platforms. This research included two surveys on open source IaaS platforms (OpenNebula, OpenStack and CloudStack) and a proprietary platform (Parallels Automation for Cloud Infrastructure-PACI) as well as on IaaS abstraction solutions (jClouds, Libcloud and Deltacloud), followed by a thorough comparison to determine the best approach. The adopted implementation reuses the Apache Deltacloud open source abstraction framework, which relies on the development of software driver modules to interface with different IaaS platforms, and involved the development of a new Deltacloud driver for PACI. The resulting interoperable solution successfully incorporates OpenNebula, OpenStack (reuses pre-existing drivers) and PACI (includes the developed Deltacloud PACI driver) nodes and provides aWeb dashboard and a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface library. The results of the exchanged data payload and time response tests performed are presented and discussed. The conclusions show that open source abstraction tools like Deltacloud allow the modular and integrated management of IaaS platforms (open source and proprietary), introduce relevant time and negligible data overheads and, as a result, can be adopted by Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) cloud providers to circumvent the vendor lock-in problem whenever service response time is not critical. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

Agent based e-learning is helpful in managing the information overload, it can serve as academic expert and manages creation of programming environment for learners. There are many characteristics that an E-learning environment has to support; they are Interaction, Data Security, User Personalization, Adaptability, Intelligence, Interoperability, Accessibility and User Authentication. E-learning must also support a few other features like cost effectiveness, reusability, storage capacity, powerful computing and virtualization which can be provided by Cloud computing. Cloud computing is everywhere these days, pick any blogs, journals, papers. The Cloud computing Architecture is built using three models, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which provides a variety of services.

abstract={Cloud Computing has been one of the most vibrant topics in the last years. Especially Platform as a Service (PaaS) is said to be a game changer for future application development. Taking away most of the configuration work, it pledges to foster rapid application development which seems even more important in a world of complex scalable distributed systems. Whereas Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is in the process of consolidation and standardization, the PaaS market is largely fragmented offering varying ecosystem capabilities. In this situation, application portability is a major concern for companies utilizing PaaS to avoid vendor lock-in and to retain the ability for future strategical decisions. To categorize portability problems of PaaS, we define a model of current PaaS offerings and identify different portability perspectives. Starting from the model, we derive a standardized profile with a common set of capabilities that can be found among PaaS providers and matched with one another to check application portability based on ecosystem capabilities. We validate our findings with a comprehensive data set of 68 PaaS offerings together with a web-based application for portability matching. We also identify further portability problems by porting the application to different PaaS vendors, validating ecosystem portability and giving hints for future research directions. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing becomes the most common product within IT markets and the global business in general. It offers a powerful and flexible resources and services including software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). On the other hand, service level agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between the cloud vendors and providers, and customers including organisations and individuals. SLA is considered as an awkward process for both providers and customers since each part has a different understanding about its detailed structure, phases and embedded elements. In this paper, a fine-defined engineering model with five well-structured phases for managing SLA in a cloud environment is introduced. This SLA engineering model will benefit both cloud providers and consumers. It will allow providers to structure and organise the SLA correctly in attractive way for customers. Simultaneously, it will provide customers with the necessary and sufficient awareness to get a fair SLA for resources or services they may access. Also, a case study is presented to demonstrate how the proposed five phases utilised to construct the required SLA in a private cloud. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Porting applications from one cloud platform to another is difficult, making vendor lock-in a major impediment to cloud adoption. Model-driven engineering could be used to determine how applications might run on different platforms, if platform schemas could be matched. However, schema matching typically relies on linguistic and structural similarities, and cloud schema terms diverge so much that such matching is impossible. To address this challenge, we introduce Prison Break: a novel, semi-automated and generic schema matching process. Prison Break solves the divergent vocabulary problem by using web search results as a similarity metric, thus incorporating domain knowledge without constructing a dictionary, lexicon or thesaurus. We tested Prison Break by matching schemas from two major cloud providers: Windows Azure and Google Application Engine. We determined that Prison Break helps solve the vendor lock-in problem by reducing the manual efforts required to map complex correspondences between cloud schemas. This brings us one step closer to automatic model migration across cloud platforms. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing has been one of the most important topics in IT which aims to assure scalable and reliable on-demand services over the Internet. The expansion of the application scope of cloud services would require cooperation between clouds from different providers that have heterogeneous functionalities. However, current cloud systems do not fully support inter-cloud interoperability and require more research work to provide sufficient functions to enable that seamless collaboration between cloud services. This paper proposes an efficient model for selecting appropriate computing resource from multi-cloud providers that is required to achieve inter-cloud interoperability in a heterogeneous Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud environment. The goal of the model is dispatching the workload on the most effective clouds available at runtime offering the best performance at the least cost. We consider that each job can have six requirements: CPU, memory, network bandwidth, serving time, maximum possible waiting time, and the priority based on the agreed Service Level Agreement (SLA) contract and service price. Additionally, we assume the SLA contract with suitable criteria between cloud-subscriber and multiple IaaS cloud-providers is signed beforehand.

abstract={Cloud computing has been one of the most important topics in IT which aims to assure scalable and reliable on-demand services over the Internet. The expansion of the application scope of cloud services would require cooperation between clouds from different providers that have heterogeneous functionalities. However, current cloud systems do not fully support inter-cloud interoperability and require more research work to provide sufficient functions to enable that seamless collaboration between cloud services. This paper proposes an efficient model for selecting appropriate computing resource from multi-cloud providers that is required to achieve inter-cloud interoperability in a heterogeneous Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud environment. The goal of the model is dispatching the workload on the most effective clouds available at runtime offering the best performance at the least cost. We consider that each job can have six requirements: CPU, memory, network bandwidth, serving time, maximum possible waiting time, and the priority based on the agreed Service Level Agreement (SLA) contract and service price. Additionally, we assume the SLA contract with suitable criteria between cloud-subscriber and multiple IaaS cloudproviders is signed beforehand. This computing resource selection model is based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). The resource selection model is evaluated using agent based model simulation. © 2014 The Authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Cloud computing, as a new system and architecture of data mutual sharing, is composed of three service models i.e. cloud software as a service (SaaS), cloud platform as a service (PaaS) and cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS), as well as including three key enabling technologies i.e. networks of fast wide-area, server computers of powerful and inexpensive specialty, and commodity hardware of high-performance virtualization. Cloud computing technology brings in innovative and constructive ideas for the medical and health informatization. However, it also challenges many traditional approaches to application design and management of medical-sanitary institutions or other datacenters, especially the relevant issues of security, interoperability, portability, et al. that cited as major barriers to broader adoption. Based on the concept, key technology, core problem and principles, the author attempts to discuss the main issues of cloud computing in the construction and development of the medical and health informatization.

abstract={The need for high reliability, availability and performance has significantly increased in modern applications, that handle rapidly growing demands while providing uninterruptible services. Cloud computing systems fundamentally provide access to large pools of data and computational resources. Eucalyptus is a software framework largely used to implement private clouds and hybrid-style Infrastructure as a Service. It implements the Amazon Web Service (AWS) API, allowing interoperability with other AWS-based services. This article investigates the software aging effects in the Eucalyptus framework, considering workloads composed of intensive requests for remote storage attachment and virtual machine instantiations. We found problems that may be harmful to system dependability and performance, specifically regarding to RAM memory and swap space exhaustion, besides highly excessive CPU utilization by the virtual machines. We also present an approach that applies time series analysis to schedule rejuvenation, so as to reduce the downtime by predicting the proper moment to perform the rejuvenation. We experimentally evaluate our approach using an Eucalyptus test bed. The results show that our approach achieves higher availability, when compared to a threshold-triggered rejuvenation method based on continuous monitoring of resources utilization. © 2014 ACM 1550-4832/2014/01-ART11 $15.00.},

abstract={The pervasiveness of connected embedded devices and Internet of Things (IoT) related application domains like smart cities, e-Health or, transportation lead to an constantly increasing amount of data, compute- and storage resources surrounding us. However, currently there is a gap between data acquisition and processing, usually bridged by gateway based approaches that integrate the devices and forward the data to Clouds in order to be processed. Integration is often static and limited to a certain application domain, which the gateway is able to support. In addition, processing does not consider the compute- and storage resources already made available by the growing amount of smart devices, like smart TVs or smart phones. As a solution, we propose the Device Cloud, which can be envisioned as an application of the Cloud Computing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) paradigms to the IoT domain. The approach will allow sharing and on demand provisioning of resources provided by the connected embedded devices surrounding us. Besides introducing an architecture draft to provide a common understanding of the overall problem, the main focus of the paper is to discuss challenges that arise and give a state of the art review of related research initiatives that are eligible to contribute to possible solutions. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is considered a successful technology, involving distributed computation infrastructures, which take advantage of the virtualization of physical resources to actuate useful scale economies. In cloud ecosystems today, attention increasingly focuses on cooperation issues, mostly in the wider context of federation. Cloud federation refers to the process of interconnecting different cloud infrastructures for resource load balancing and to manage demand spikes. One of the biggest advantages of a federated cloud consists of the possibility of distributing the workload over different cloud providers, rather than obtaining cloud services from just a single supplier. In addition, federation could be very important for Big Data, for example, to implement policies allowing migration for virtual machines involved in data analysis next to storage hosting Big Data. Federation, automation, standards, and interoperability are crucial for cloud computing services to be successful in the near future. Standards are crucial for both interoperability and federation, and federation is the first step toward interoperability. The idea we describe in this paper comes from the assumption that some of Cloud Infrastructure offering IaaS (e.g., Open-Stack, OpenNebula) provide interfaces based on the OCCI standard, but lack an interconnecting cooperation/federation awareness layer. We propose a software infrastructure able to provide a homogeneous interface among different Cloud managers, in order to coordinate the IaaS resources in a transparent and distributed manner. We have implemented such software, based on CLEVER, a novel Cloud Middleware jointly developed by INFN Catania and the University of Messina, which uses XMPP as interconnecting communication protocol. We also present: • an interface for the Catania Science Gateway Framework implementing a simple dashboard • a testbed used in the framework of the CHAIN-REDS Project, which includes sites belonging to the EGI Federated Cloud. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence.},

abstract={The cloud computing paradigm promises increased flexibility and scalability for consumers and providers of software services. Service providers that exploit private cloud environments offer restricted flexibility and scalability because of the limited capacity. However, such organizations are often reluctant to migrate to public clouds because of business continuity threats and vendor lock-in. Hybrid clouds potentially combine the benefits of private and public (external) clouds. Vendor lock-in can be avoided when multiple external clouds are supported and effectively exploited. This paper presents a middleware platform for hybrid cloud applications. The middleware enables organizations to control the execution of their applications in hybrid cloud environments. Driven by policies, the middleware can dynamically decide which requests and tasks are executed on a particular part of the hybrid cloud. The core of the middleware, and the focus of this paper, is an abstraction layer. The abstraction layer enables portability over multiple services including data storage, blob storage, and asynchronous task execution of various PaaS platforms as well as interoperability between the PaaS platforms. We have validated the core concept by building a prototype implementation that runs on top of specific PaaS platforms as well as on a cloud-enabling middleware. A document processing SaaS application has been instantiated on the middleware. Performance results have been collected for JBoss AS cluster, Google App Engine, and Red Hat OpenShift. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Among the various industry sectors, the financial industry in South Africa (SA) has been one of the early adopters of cloud computing (CC) but they have not fully implemented it because of barriers such as security and privacy, governance issues, inadequate cloud service level agreements (SLAs), vendor lock in, poor vendor transparency, inability to assess risks, confidentiality, integrity and availability. Few guidelines exist to help organizations improve their CC readiness level. This is particularly risky for financial institutions that deal with sensitive customer information as the safety of that information is not guaranteed if a desired readiness level is not attained before implementation. In order to assist financial institutions with this hurdle, this paper proposes a framework that will serve as a tool by which financial institutions can determine and improve their CC readiness. The framework is called 'Becoming Cloud Computing Ready' (BCCR) and it would help financial institutions to determine which stage they are with their CC readiness. It will also provide guidelines that will assist financial institutions to improve their level of readiness in order to ensure successful CC adoption. The proposed framework is grounded in both the literature as well as empirical data obtained from interviews with the largest financial institutions in SA. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, we have seen the rapid emergence of a plethora of Cloud providers with individual infrastructures, APIs and application description formats. This heterogeneity has resulted in vendor lock-in, which reduces consumer flexibility in terms of negotiation power, reaction to price increases and freedom to change provider. Achieving interoperability between Clouds is a means of addressing this issue. To realise this, the use of open standards has been suggested, but the existing standards are focused mainly on portability instead of interoperability. Besides, this heterogenous nature of Clouds makes inter-Cloud monitoring to facilitate interoperable Cloud management difficult. In this paper, we present a novel integrated approach to achieve interoperability between Clouds and to facilitate the management of service provisioning using multiple Clouds. The approach is based on the integration of a holistic message bus system with monitoring techniques. We present the design and implementation descriptions, and based on a use case scenario, we demonstrate a practical realisation of our approach. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Vendor lock-in and cloud outages are two important challenges that make IT managers reluctant in widely adopting the cloud within the enterprise. Vendor lock-in happens when the adoption of cloud provider-specific technologies and APIs forces consumers to stay with the same provider even if they would like to change. Cloud outages can happen to any provider, as the events of the last years have largely demonstrated, and have a critical impact on the actual reliability of cloud applications. A solution to both problems could be to support application developers and operators in the adoption of a multi-cloud approach: applications are built to run and replicate on different clouds, and mechanisms for fast switching from a cloud installation to the other are offered. In the MODAClouds project we pursue this approach and rely on model-driven development combined with risk analysis and quality prediction. In this paper we provide an overview of our approach and present the architecture of the corresponding platform. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources offered by commercial providers according to specific service level agreements. Research effort has been spent to address the lack of Cloud interoperability that is a barrier to cloud-computing adoption because of the vendor lock-in problem. In fact the ability to easily move workloads and data from one cloud provider to another or between private and public clouds can improve performance, availability and reduce costs.

abstract={The paper addresses the field of cloud computing, more specifically the SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) layer of cloud computing. Although the usage of the SaaS applications has become very popular in recent years, their end-users are still facing certain limitations. In fact, several users leverage more than one SaaS application without any possibility of integrating heterogeneous data. Also, they are often bound to a specific application due to the "vendor lock-in" problem and they are not always given the option to maintain data backups outside the provider's data centers. Hence, we address these issues by introducing a model providing a unified platform for (i) preparing data backups, (ii) executing data migration and (iii) performing data integration among different SaaS applications. We evaluate the proposed model by performing a demonstrational implementation.},

abstract={Parallel scientific workloads typically entail highly-customised software environments, involving complex data structures, specialised systems software, and even distinct hardware, where virtualisation is not necessarily supported by third-party providers. Considering the expansion of cloud computing in different domains and the development of different proprietary (e.g. Amazon Web Services, Azure) and open source cloud platforms (Eucalyptus, OpenStack, OpenNebula), users should arguably be able to automatically and seamlessly migrate their parallel workloads across cloud platforms using standardised virtual machines. However, even if it is easier to migrate the workload between nodes when the nodes have a similar configuration on the same platform, the transition between different platforms typically raises different issues such as vendor lock-in, portability, and interoperability. In this paper, we describe our work to automatically deploy a complex parallel software stack on heterogeneous hybrid cloud platforms. We have elastically deployed FastFlow - a C/C++ pattern-based programming framework for multi-/many-core and distributed platforms - using virtual machines on both CPU and GPU-based architectures between heterogeneous virtualised platforms. Our approach relies on the standard Open Virtualization Format (OVF) in order to achieve a universal description of virtual appliances. Such a description is not only useful for elastically migrating and deploying, but also to determine the hardware/system software configuration needed switching to any new (cloud) image format. We have successfully evaluated our work using virtual machines based on VirtualBox and Amazon Web Services on local cluster and public cloud providers. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increasing distribution and integration of mobile devices into today's information systems, there is a growing demand for interoperability between heterogeneous computation systems. Cloud systems already serve as an integration point between heterogeneous devices using classic client/server concepts such as web services. However, this technology significantly limits possible applications. In this paper we consider virtual machines as a possible solution for extending the applicability for integration of mobile devices into cloud systems. We investigate the concept of migrating VM instances between clouds and local devices also considering heterogeneous computing architectures like ARM and x86. We are using an off-line approach, where a VM is transferred without being responsive. A stop, move and resume process is already sufficient for certain use cases and could increase interoperability and reduce vendor lock-in effects. We present an approach for off-line VM migration between OpenStack and local devices and evaluate our proof of concept implementation. Our results for migration costs and performance show several challenges and the need for further optimization. However, even the unoptimized migration costs might already be acceptable in certain scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.},

However, heterogeneous virtualization technologies offered by different service providers with disparate infrastructure and their orchestration and management systems have also increased the complexity of managing distributed applications and vendor lock-in. In this paper we utilize new computing, management and programming models introduced using the DIME network architecture to provide end to end service visibility and control across distributed physical or virtual infrastructure. Resulting decoupling of application and service transaction management from myriad distributed infrastructure management systems at run-time enables policy based, secure, service mobility across physical servers or virtual machines deployed in data enters or public clouds. Using the new architecture we have implemented service self-repair, auto-scaling, live-migration and end-to-end service transaction security independent of server and network security mechanisms. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the most essential requirements to make use of the benefits of Cloud computing is fully automated provisioning and deployment of applications including all related resources. This leads to crucial cost reductions when deploying and operating applications in the Cloud because manual processes are slow, error-prone, and thus costly. Both Cloud providers and the open-source community provide a huge variety of tools, APIs, domain-specific languages, and reusable artifacts to implement deployment automation. However, the meta-models behind these approaches are diverse. This diversity makes it challenging to combine different approaches, avoiding vendor lock-in and tooling lock-in. In this work we propose deployment aggregates as a generic means to use and orchestrate different kinds of deployment approaches. We define a generic meta-model and show its relation to existing meta-models in the domain of deployment automation. Moreover, we discuss how existing artifacts can be used as deployment aggregates as a result of transformation and enrichment. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditional cloud computing providers enable developers to program and deploy applications in the cloud by using platform as a service (PaaS) providers. Despite the benefits of such an approach, this service model usually comes with a high level of the lock in effect into the service provider. The lock in effect occurs when a software developer needs to change its cloud provider. When this happens, it usually means a major application rewrite, specific for the new PaaS. This paper details the initial results of a project whose goal is to build a PaaS where vendor lock in does not occur. With this PaaS, developers wishing to deploy their applications into the cloud may continue to program using their usual development environments. There are no necessary changes required to make the application PaaS compatible. As a proof of concept, we developed an open source PaaS management application as a regular web application and then deployed it on the cloud. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

abstract={Performance assessment is a key factor in designing distributed simulation environments that are fit-forpurpose and cost-effective. Simulations used for training applications should provide the required level of responsiveness and interactivity. Simulations used for analysis or decision support should execute as fast as possible to enable quick results on large numbers of scenarios and variables. There are many parameters that have an impact on the performance of a typical High Level Architecture (HLA) federation. We describe a structured process for using data farming (experiment design, simulation, cloud computing, and data mining) in order to identify key parameters affecting the performance of HLA federations. A parameterized and instrumented federation is designed with parameters covering areas suspected of impacting HLA performance and instrumentation measuring key values of HLA performance. One key parameter set for HLA performance is the computing platform that hosts the federation. Varying such a platform in an efficient and cost effective manner is possible using cloud computing via Infrastructure-as-a- Service providers. Finally, the performance measures captured during federation execution are collated and analysed using data mining techniques to identify key parameters and their effect on the performance of the federation. By including the Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) as a parameter in the federation design, it may also be possible to identify where the HLA itself (instead of particular RTIs or computing platforms) is impacting on simulation performance. Initial results from this process are presented and future work, including the creation of a HLA performance model from identified parameters, is discussed.

Cloud Computing (CC) is an important up to date computing concept for NE, as it offers significant financial and technical advantages beside high-level collaboration possibilities. As cloud computing is a new concept the solutions for handling interoperability, portability, security, privacy and standardization challenges have not been solved fully yet. The paper introduces the main characteristics of future Internet-based enterprises and the different CC models. An overview is given on interoperability and actual standardization issues in CC environments. A taxonomy on possible connecting forms of networked enterprises and cloud-based IT systems with reference on interoperability is introduced, parallel presenting four use cases as well. Finally, an example of connecting cloud and NE is presented as an effective application of cloud computing in manufacturing industry. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cloud data centers are becoming the preferred deployment environment for a wide range of business applications because they provide many benefits compared to private in-house infrastructure. However, the traditional approach of using a single cloud has several limitations in terms of availability, avoiding vendor lock-in, and providing legislation-compliant services with suitable Quality of Experience (QoE) to users worldwide. One way for cloud clients to mitigate these issues is to use multiple clouds (i.e., a Multi-Cloud). In this article, we introduce an approach for deploying three-tier applications across multiple clouds in order to satisfy their key nonfunctional requirements. We propose adaptive, dynamic, and reactive resource provisioning and load distribution algorithms that heuristically optimize overall cost and response delays without violating essential legislative and regulatory requirements. Our simulation with realistic workload, network, and cloud characteristics shows that our method improves the state of the art in terms of availability, regulatory compliance, and QoE with acceptable sacrifice in cost and latency. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Nowadays, data-intensive scientific research needs storage capabilities that enable efficient data sharing. This is of great importance for many scientific domains such as the Virtual Physiological Human. In this paper, we introduce a solution that federates a variety of systems ranging from file servers to more sophisticated ones used in clouds or grids. Our solution follows a client-centric approach that loosely couples a variety of data resources that may use different technologies such as Openstack-Swift, iRODS, GridFTP, and may be geographically distributed. It is implemented as a lightweight service which does not require installation of a software on the resources it uses. In this way we are able to efficiently use heterogeneous storage resources, reduce the usage complexity of multiple storage resources, and avoid vendor lock-in in case of cloud storage. To demonstrate the usability of our approach we performed a number of experiments that assess the performance and functionality of the developed system. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Over the recent years, the rapid development of Cloud Computing has driven to a large market of cloud services that offer infrastructure, platforms and software to everyday users. Yet, due to the lack of common accepted standards, cloud service providers use different technologies and offer their clients services that are operated by a variety of proprietary APIs. The lack of standardization results in numerous heterogeneities (e.g., heterogeneous service descriptions, message level naming conflicts, data representation conflicts etc.) making the interoperation, collaboration and portability of services a very complex task. In this work we focus on the problems of interoperability and portability in Cloud Computing, we address their differences and we discuss some of the latest research work in this area. Finally we evaluate and point out relationships between the identified solutions. Copyright © 2014 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications.},

abstract={With the recent advances in cloud computing and the improvement in the capabilities of mobile devices in terms of speed, storage, and computing power, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is emerging as one of important branches of cloud computing. MCC is an extension of cloud computing with the support of mobility. In this paper, we first present the specific concerns and key challenges in mobile cloud computing, we then discuss the different approaches to tackle the main issues in MCC that have been introduced so far, and finally we focus on describing the proposed overall architecture of a middleware that will contribute to providing mobile users data storage and processing services based on their mobile devices capabilities, availability, and usage. A prototype of the middleware is developed and three scenarios are described to demonstrate how the middleware performs in adapting the provision of cloud web services by transforming SOAP messages to REST and XML format to JSON, in optimizing the results by extracting relevant information, and in improving the availability by caching. Initial analysis shows that the mobile cloud middleware improves the quality of service for mobiles, and provides lightweight responses for mobile cloud services. © 2014 IEEE.},

Hence, this article presents an approach to fulfill those requirements based on PLCopen standard and Cloud Computing. A novel architecture of the embedded computer numerical control system is proposed, and the characteristics of the embedded computer numerical control system are discussed. The PLCopen standard is charged of real-time motion control, offering interoperability, feasibility, simplicity, and universality characteristics. The Cloud Computing technology is used to improve the system performance and to extend functions, overcoming the problem that the intelligence requirement is not compatible with limited hardware resource.

Mobile devices, such as, smartphones or tablets play a key role for these purposes. The presence of dissimilar technologies among cloud providers is delivering chaos to the function of interoperability among providers. The existence of several technologies, terminologies, architectures, and business strategies are contributing to aggravate thins even further. In this paper, cloud computing providers, architecture, service, and deployment stack are discussed. Then, a cloud instance interoperability model is proposed. This model is presented to solve the interoperability issue between cloud providers.

abstract={One of the key benefits of Cloud systems is their ability to provide elastic, on-demand (seemingly infinite) computing capability and performance for supporting service delivery. With the resource availability in single data centres proving to be limited, the option of obtaining extra-resources from a collection of Cloud providers has appeared as an efficacious solution. The ability to utilize resources from multiple Cloud providers is also often mentioned as a means to: (i) prevent vendor lock in, (ii) to enable in house capacity to be combined with an external Cloud provider, (iii) combine specialist capability from multiple Cloud vendors (especially when one vendor does not offer such capability or where such capability may come at a higher price). Such federation of Cloud systems can therefore overcome a limit in capacity and enable providers to dynamically increase the availability of resources to serve requests. We describe and evaluate the establishment of such a federation using a CometCloud based implementation, and consider a number of federation policies with associated scenarios and determine the impact of such policies on the overall status of our system. CometCloud provides an overlay that enables multiple types of Cloud systems (both public and private) to be federated through the use of specialist gateways.

abstract={Cloud Brokers enable interoperability and portability of applications across multiple Cloud Providers. On the other hand, incoming Cloud Providers start to support more and more unbundled Cloud Instances offerings. Thus, consumers may set up at their will the quantity of CPU, network bandwidth and memory or hard disk capacities their Cloud Instances will have. These facts enable the standardization of interoperable Cloud Instance configurations. In this paper, CompatibleOne is presented as an approach to bring Cloud Computing as a commodity. For this, the requirements to make of a product a commodity have been identified and have been mapped into the CompatibleOne architecture components. Our approach shows the practical feasibility of bringing Cloud Computing as a commodity. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is fast becoming one of the most essential research topics for distributed resource networks. Users can easily access cloud while offloading their mobile applications from anywhere anytime. Being easy to access, intruder attacks mobile networks to acquire credential from mobile applications inside and outside the cloud computing. To investigate intruder's attacks, digital investigator has to identify the root cause of the attack. However, investigating MCC infrastructure is difficult due to its characteristics of virtualization, dispersion of data, multi tenancy, interoperability, and mobility. In this paper, we present an overview of MCC and digital forensics, focusing on its key aspects and significant forensic challenges faced by digital investigators in MCC. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding about forensic research challenges and re-direct researchers towards new research areas. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Previously the traditional healthcare information system that used in the healthcare sector was the paper-based and then later it was replaced by the Healthcare Information System (HIS). However the HIS was found not perform effectively because of several issues such as storage capacity, system integration, high operating cost and system maintenance. Cloud computing is a new technology that deliver the software, infrastructure and computational platform as a service over the Internet in any place and any time. This technology has been said can solve many problems of the healthcare system such as increase the storage capacity and add new capability on the existing healthcare system. Cloud computing offers cost effective, increase interoperability and accessibility, optimize resources and integrate the healthcare information systems. It becomes a solution for solving the current issues, which lead to enhance functionality and features of the healthcare information systems. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the cloud computing technology as solution for healthcare information system issues. Issues such as data transmission, data storage, cost and maintenance issues are presented and described. The implications of this study then discussed. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.},

abstract={When considering the economics of information security, people often use the information's value as input into an equation to determine how much to spend securing the corresponding system. Here, we explore how to improve the amount of security obtainable for a given cost. Looking at real-world examples, it is clear that the cost for proper se- curity remains high due to poor security foundations, poor interoperability, and challenges around deploying security primitives. These problems lie on the boundary between research and practice, which only further complicates the creation of useful solutions. This talk aims to start a conversation around how these communities can come together to address these challenges. Copyright © 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. (ACM).},

abstract={A brief review of the Internet history reveals the fact that the Internet evolved after the formation of primarily independent networks. Similarly, interconnected clouds, also called Inter-cloud, can be viewed as a natural evolution of cloud computing. Recent studies show the benefits in utilizing multiple clouds and present attempts for the realization of an Inter-cloud or federated cloud environment. However, cloud vendors have not taken into account cloud interoperability issues, and each cloud comes with its own solution and interfaces for services. This survey initially discusses all the relevant aspects motivating cloud interoperability. Furthermore, it categorizes and identifies possible cloud interoperability scenarios and architectures. The spectrum of challenges and obstacles that the Inter-cloud realization is faced with are covered, a taxonomy of them is provided, and fitting enablers that tackle each challenge are identified. All these aspects require a comprehensive review of the state of the art, including ongoing projects and studies in the area. We conclude by discussing future directions and trends toward the holistic approach in this regard. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Cloud computing (the delivery of computing as services rather than products) creates new challenges with respect to openness. Existing approaches such as open source licensing of software products have proven inadequate in a service-oriented world; attempts to address the limitations by closing the 'service provider loophole' have failed to gain traction. Similarly, multiple providers are yet to fully adopt a single, complete cloud infrastructure management interface. In this paper a simple 'lowest common denominator' approach to cloud portability is proposed, modeled after the success of Internet email and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and based on the ubiquitous HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The proposed approach is suitable for all workloads and supports any format specified elsewhere and identified by Internet media (MIME) type (e.g. virtual machines, databases, queues). By addressing only the functionality absolutely required for portability, leaving the management interface out of scope, we can deliver an API which is compatible with all cloud stacks while avoiding constraining their functionality. © 2014 IEEE.},

To be widely adopted, such ontology must be extremely flexible, coping with a wide range of use cases: from the minimalist plug-and-play user, to the one governing a complex infrastructure. Our work is based on the Open Cloud Computing Interface, that is an open, community driven OGF standard allowing boundary-level interfaces to be built using RESTful patterns over HTTP. Among others, OpenStack and OpenNebula adopt OCCI. Using the OCCI ontology we define two kinds that are associated with the basic components of a monitoring infrastructure: The collector link, that performs measurements, and the sensor resource, that aggregates data and undertakes actions. This paper is a compact and self-contained revision of a document currently under discussion inside the OCCI community. Copyright © 2014 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications.},

abstract={Standards are an important part of any product or service as they impact many aspects such as interoperability, portability, and security. Hence, they constitute the cornerstone of any distributed, open, and flexible system - even more so for emerging technologies such as cloud computing as the rate of their adoption can heavily depend on it. Often there is a plethora of standards available and - despite their importance - accurate information that can be used to guide the selection of standards is missing. Selecting the wrong standards can increase cost, reduce uptake, profitability, or lead to a product or service being stuck in a niche. Selecting the right standards can result in as much as the exact opposite. Despite numerous efforts to create classifications of standards that should provide guidance for the selection of standards, there is a lack of conceptualization and methods on how to build standards classifications. In this paper, we provide a conceptualization of technology standards, which serves as the basis for our method to classify standards in emerging technologies (C-SET). The method provides a procedure to classify standards based on a conceptual data model and a stakeholder model. In doing so, C-SET provides the basis to structure the information that is required for an informed selection of standards in emerging technologies. In this paper, we illustrate C-SET referring to cloud computing as an example of an emerging technology.},

abstract={OCCI (Open Cloud Computing Interface) is an open protocol for management of tasks in the cloud environment focused on integration, portability and interoperability with a high degree of extensibility. It is designed to bridge differences between various cloud platforms and provide common ground for users and developers alike. The rOCCI framework, originally developed by GWDG, later adopted and now maintained by CESNET, was written to simplify implementation of the OCCI 1.1 protocol in Ruby and later provided the base for working client and server components giving OCCI support to multiple cloud platforms while ensuring interoperability with other existing implementations. The initial server-side component provided basic functionality and served as a proof of concept when it was adopted by the EGI Federated Cloud Task and was chosen to act as the designated virtual machine management interface. This led to further funding from the EGI-InSPIRE project, development of a full featured client and a new rOCCI-server suitable for production environment. It has also prompted further proliferation of the OCCI protocol, spawned multiple connector/backend implementations and provided developers with valuable feedback and opportunities to test their own implementations of the OCCI standard. This paper aims to provide basic information about the OCCI protocol, introduce its implementation in rOCCI, describe some of the core functionality provided by the rOCCI client and rOCCI-server along with their impact on interoperability in the cloud environment. It also briefly examines its use in the EGI Federated Cloud Task environment and explores the possibility of further integration with other cloud platforms. All this with interoperability in mind. The paper also describes a carefully chosen subset of problems encountered whilst trying to provide interoperability with multiple cloud platforms through the use of the OCCI protocol, with real-world examples and chosen solutions.},

abstract={Cloud computing has evolved towards a model of computing that is already used widely, and often is the choice for new applications and services that are to be built. The trend is not only observable in commercial applications but also in academic ones. Since the beginnings of cloud computing deployment models of federated and hybrid clouds have always been part of the discussions. However, in practice federated clouds are hard to achieve since cloud stacks tend to be heterogeneous and lock their customers in. In this work we discuss an architecture that adds a layer of abstraction on top of the existing architecture of infrastructure clouds and makes implementation details of different cloud stacks transparent to the user. This way we can mitigate some problems that are introduced with distributed federated heterogeneous clouds. Further we introduce a process that allows for wide-area virtual machine migration on top of this architecture and show why this approach is feasible in practical applications. © 2013 - Society for Design and Process Science.},

abstract={A smart city scenario based on an efficient wireless network allows users to benefit from multimedia services in an ubiquitous, seamless and interoperable way. In this context Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) and Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) are viewed as infrastructures providing together a key solution for the major facing problems: the former allows to offload application to powerful remote servers, shortening execution time and extending battery life of mobile devices, while the latter allows the use of small cells in addition to macrocells, exploiting high-speed and stable connectivity in an ever grown mobile traffic trend. In this paper, we propose a technique aiming to move towards the cloud only a fraction of the computing application by minimizing a cost function, that take into account a tradeoff between energy consumption and execution time, in a non-trivial multi-objective optimization approach. The results show that when the application requires high execution and data workload and simultaneously the network is overloaded, a particular value of this percentage best fits the performance. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is emerging as a viable platform for scientific exploration. The ideas of on-demand access to resources, 'unlimited' resources as well as interesting pricing models are making scientist to move their workflows into cloud computing. However, the amount of services and different pricing models offered by the providers often overwhelm users when deciding which option is best for them. Moreover, interoperability across providers remains an open topic that forces users to develop specific solutions for each provider. In this paper, we present a service framework that enables the autonomic execution of dynamic workflows in multi-cloud environments. It also allows users to customize scheduling policies to use those resources that best fit their needs. To demonstrate the benefits of this framework, we study the execution of a real scientific workflow, with data dependencies across stages, in a multi-cloud federation using different policies and objective functions. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Deduplication of primary storage volumes in a cloud computing environment is increasingly desirable, as the resulting space savings contribute to the cost effectiveness of a large scale multi-tenant infrastructure. However, traditional archival and backup deduplication systems impose prohibitive overhead for latency-sensitive applications deployed at these infrastructures while, current primary deduplication systems rely on special cluster filesystems, centralized components, or restrictive workload assumptions. We present DEDIS, a fully-distributed and dependable system that performs exact and cluster-wide background deduplication of primary storage. DEDIS does not depend on data locality and works on top of any unsophisticated storage backend, centralized or distributed, that exports a basic shared block device interface. The evaluation of an open-source prototype shows that DEDIS scales out and adds negligible overhead even when deduplication and intensive storage I/O run simultaneously. © 2014 IFIP Internatinal Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={In latest years, the concept of interconnecting clouds to allow common service coordination has gained significant attention mainly because of the increasing utilization of cloud resources from Internet users. An efficient common management between different clouds is essential benefit, like boundless elasticity and scalability. Yet, issues related with different standards led to interoperability problems. For this reason, the definition of the open cloud-computing interface defines a set of open community-lead specifications along with a flexible API to build cloud systems. Today, there are cloud systems like OpenStack, OpenNebula, Amazon Web Services and VMWare VCloud that expose APIs for inter-cloud communication. In this work we aim to explore an inter-cloud model by creating a new cloud platform service to act as a mediator among OpenStack, FI-WARE datacenter resource management and Amazon Web Service cloud architectures, therefore to orchestrate communication of various cloud environments. The model is based on the FI-WARE and will be offered as a reusable enabler with an open specification to allow interoperable service coordination. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

End users and developers of domain-specific software abstractions often have to deal with the heterogeneity of such batch processing systems. This lead to a number of application programming interface and job description standards in the past, which are implemented and established for cluster and Grid systems. With the recent rise of cloud computing as new utility computing paradigm, the standardized access to batch processing facilities operated on cloud resources becomes an important issue. Furthermore, the design of such a standard has to consider a tradeoff between feature completeness and the achievable level of interoperability.

abstract={The demand for cloud computing has greatly increased in the past few years due to the offering of computing as a service form. The vendor-dependent implementation of cloud service providers, cloud interoperability, is an immense concern for cloud users as well as service providers. Another issue is the difficulty of selecting an appropriate provider considering the specific user requirements and a diverse vendor centric approach. Besides the standardization process, one of the most significant current discussions in cloud computing is the cloud-brokering service. Cloud brokering is having a positive impact in choosing an appropriate provider along with the capability to handle cloud-to-cloud communication. From the recent proposals, we re-evaluate the brokering and load-balancing algorithms with a generated workload. This study produced results that corroborate the findings of a great deal of the previous work in this field. The current findings of recent works add to a growing body of literature on cloud-brokering and load-balancing algorithms. In this paper, we revisited existing cloud-brokering algorithms in order to propose a new cloud-brokering architecture with the enhancement of brokering algorithms to improve brokering performance. Another contribution is to identify the best combination of all the proposed algorithms based on the processing time and response time. © 2014 by the IETE.},

In order to improve efficiency of testing in special network environment, this paper presents a generic and systematic development process for automated passive interoperability testing and the development process are language and system technology independent. This method mainly monitors the exchange message between IUTs and checks these message with composite global finite state machines which are generated based on standard and protocol. And the method also considers aspects including system partition, trace verification, verdicts, and limitations of the System under Test (SUT). In addition, this paper also introduces every step of development process for automated testing and some related algorithm which are presented based on the Communication Finite State Machine (CFSM) model.

abstract={Over the past decade, Cloud Computing has rapidly become a widely accepted paradigm with core concepts such as elasticity, scalability and on demand automatic resource provisioning emerging as next generation Cloud service-must have-properties. Automatic resource provisioning for Cloud applications is not a trivial task, requiring for both the applications and platform, to be constantly monitored, capturing information at various levels and time granularity. In this paper we describe the challenges that occur when monitoring elastically adaptive Cloud applications and to address these issues we present JCatascopia, a fully automated, multi-layer, interoperable Cloud Monitoring System. Experiments on different production Cloud platforms show that JCatascopia is a Monitoring System capable of supporting a fully automated Cloud resource provisioning system with proven interoperability, scalability and low runtime footprint. Most importantly, JCatascopia is able to adapt in a fully automatic manner when elasticity actions are enforced to an application deployment. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The Cloud model is cost-effective because customers pay for their actual usage without upfront costs, and scalable because it can be used more or less depending onthe customers' needs. Due to its advantages, Cloud has beenincreasingly adopted in many areas, such as banking, ecommerce,retail industry, and academy. For education, cloud is used to manage the large volume of educationalresources produced across many universities in the cloud. Keep interoperability between content in an inter-university Cloud is not always easy. Diffusion of pedagogical contentson the Cloud by different E-Learning institutions leads to heterogeneous content which influence the quality of teachingoffered by university to teachers and learners. From thisreason, comes the idea of using IMS-LD coupled with metadata in the cloud. This paper presents the implementation of our previous educational modeling by combining anapplication in J2EE with Reload editor that consists of modeling heterogeneous content in the cloud. The new approachthat we followed focuses on keeping interopera bility between Educational Cloud content for teachers and learners and facilitates the task of identification, reuse, sharing, adapting teaching and learning resources in the Cloud.},

abstract={When envisioning "The Cloud," one is often presented with an idyllic black box of functionality that seamlessly stores arbitrary amounts of data while providing endless CPU cycles. However, Cloud deployments are often partitioned along institutional and middleware boundaries that link computation and storage infrastructures. Decoupling storage from computation resource providers allows for greater flexibility in resource provisioning and new data storage paradigms to emerge. This paper proposes a decentralized data management architecture that facilitates interoperability between Clouds and other heterogeneous systems. The goals of this research are to augment the latent storage capacity within provisioned Cloud VMs with existing institutional resources to build low-cost Storage Clouds for scientific computing.

However, medical information systems in each organization are different from each other. These different systems compose a heterogeneous, distributed system with high complexity: there are a large number of healthcare related applications that support specific needs effectively but are isolated or incompatible. Thus medical information systems' interoperability constitutes one of the main challenges of the IT society. Semantic interoperability in healthcare is important especially when all the varying types of data need to interact.

Each infrastructure having its own and different management operating software, the integration of different platforms becomes a hard and complicated task. Solving the interoperability problem for a set of different computing infrastructures belonging to our institution in order to solve a computation intensive problem was our objective. The paper describes the solution that was applied and the experimental results obtained. The solution uses a platform based on a central bus shared by the involved system components for information exchange. In order to ensure that all computations will succeed, the solution includes cloud infrastructures to deal with situations in which the local computing resources pose some problems. Also a cloud based solution for the bus deployment is explored and empirically compared with a local deployment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Smart Grid has been characterized as the next generation power grid in which modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) will improve control, reliability and safety. Although the adoption of generic off-the-shelf ICT in Smart Grid provisions indisputable advantages and benefits, it raises several issues concerning the reliability and security of communications - the core infrastructure of Smart Grid. Cloud computing has developed and evolved over the past years becoming a real choice for Smart Grids infrastructure because of the availability, scalability, performance and interoperability that it offers. In this paper we present a survey of the existing cloud-based software platforms for implementing secure Smart Grids. Security issues like authentication and authorization of users, data encryption, availability, attacker impact, detection and trust management have received significant attention in previous work. Nevertheless, as shown in this paper, their integration and adaptation to emerging fields such as Smart Grid is still in an embryonic state. As such, we report recent advancements and software platforms specifically for Smart Grid and we outline several issues as well as suggestions for designing security-aware platforms for Smart Grid. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The pervasive availability of cheap cloud computing services for data storage, either as persistence layer to applications or as mere object store dedicated to final users, is remarkably increasing the chance that cloud platforms potentially host evidence of criminal activity. Once presented a proper court order, cloud providers would be in the best position for extracting relevant data from their platforms in the most reliable and complete way. However, this kind of services are not so widespread to date and, therefore, the need to adopt a structured and forensically sound approach calls for innovative weaponry which leverage the data harvesting capabilities offered by the low level program interfaces exposed by providers. This paper describes the concepts and internals of the Cloud Data Imager Library, a mediation layer that offers a read only access to files and metadata of selected remote folders and currently supports access to Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft Skydrive storage facilities. A demo application has been build on top of the library which allows directory browsing, file content view and imaging of folder trees with export to widespread forensic formats. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Thanks to its high flexibility, cost-effectiveness and availability, Cloud Computing has quickly imposed itself on the IT scenery, rapidly flooding the market with new appealing services and offers. However, the current lack of a shared standard for the description of such services can represent an obstacle to the development of interoperable and portable Cloud solutions. The approach we investigate consists in the creation of a set of interrelated OWL ontologies, which describe both Cloud Services and APIs/methods used to invoke them, together with their relative parameters. Furthermore, OWL-S is exploited to describe the internal workflow of the described services. Our representation also offers means to describe Resources Configurations, which can be compared by means of SPARQL queries, enabling users to easily choose among the different offers proposed by competing vendors. In this paper we apply the proposed semantic based representation to the description of the Openstack offer, which represents an optimal case study to test and prove its effectiveness. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Most cloud computing service providers secure their offered cloud services by username/password schemes, which have been proven to be weak. While such schemes may be sufficient for simple personalised services, e-government or e-health applications in the cloud require more reliable and stronger mechanisms. One of such mechanisms is electronic IDs (eIDs), which allow for unique qualified identification and strong authentication. EIDs have been rolled-out in many EU member states for years. In this paper, we present how various national eIDs can be used for secure cloud authentication. We therefore extended the STORK eID interoperability framework, which will be the relevant identification and authentication framework across Europe in future. Furthermore, we increased usability by additionally applying single sign-on (SSO). Single sign-on defines the ability to authenticate just once in a distributed environment and gain access to several protected services. In fact, by our extended STORK architecture citizens of 18 EU member states-those member states that support STORK-are able to use seamless authentication at different cloud service providers by using their own national eID.

This paper aims to identify a promising and achievable cloud based solution which enables patients to share the health information when multiple stakeholders are involved for different purposes. A prototype on the case of type 2 diabetes is implemented as a proof of concept for the proposed hybrid cloud based solution. The hybrid cloud environment is composed of Open Stack and Amazon Web Services with open source libs. And the exchanging health data contains in HL7 CCD format.

abstract={Medical imaging is an important tool for medical diagnosis and treatment. Historically, this tool has been taking advantage of the computer technology advances. In fact, medical imaging has been more and more supported by computers. An example is the creation of image acquisition processes based on computational methods, like magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. Another example is the appearance of Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) concept, which is an umbrella term that embraces the systems responsible for the medical imaging acquisition, archive, distribution, visualization and management. In general, public cloud computing services have many advantages. They have potential to support medical imaging services and processes in distributed environments. For instance, they can be used to support centralized storage of medical imaging data, including the establishment of regional archives, releasing the healthcare institutions from the duties of maintaining an infrastructure capable of storing a huge amount of data. Another scenario is to support a broker of communications between institutions, taking advantage of cloud services availability and scalability. Nevertheless, such technologic choice has several risks, due to specificities of medical imaging scenario, especially about security and data access latency. This chapter identifies the challenges of using cloud in demanding medical imaging scenario and consequent strategies to solve or minimize them. Furthermore, it has proposed an architecture that combines distinct technological approaches to deal with data privacy, communication latency and protocol interoperability. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={In cloud computing environments, data storage systems often rely on optimistic replication to provide good performance and availability even in the presence of failures or network partitions. In this scenario, it is important to be able to accurately and efficiently identify updates executed concurrently. Current approaches to causality tracking in optimistic replication have problems with concurrent updates: they either (1) do not scale, as they require replicas to maintain information that grows linearly with the number of writes or unique clients; (2) lose information about causality, either by removing entries from client-id based version vectors or using server-id based version vectors, which cause false conflicts. We propose a new logical clock mechanism and a logical clock framework that together support a traditional key-value store API, while capturing causality in an accurate and scalable way, avoiding false conflicts. It maintains concise information per data replica, only linear on the number of replica servers, and allows data replicas to be compared and merged linear with the number of replica servers and versions. © 2014 IFIP Internatinal Federation for Information Processing.},

These services automate the identification of term candidates in user documents, and the lookup of translation equivalents in online terminology resources and on the Web by automatically extracting multilingual terminology from comparable and parallel online resources. Collaborative involvement of users contributes to the refinement and enrichment of the raw terminological data. Finally, we present the TaaS platform, which implements this servicebased model, particularly focusing on the processing of Web content.},

abstract={Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is arising as a prominent research area that is seeking to bring the massive advantages of the cloud to the constrained smartphones. Mobile devices are looking towards cloud-aware techniques, driven by their growing interest to provide ubiquitous PC-like functionality to mobile users these functionalities mainly target at increasing storage and computational capabilities. Smartphones may integrate those functionalities from different cloud levels, in a service oriented manner within the mobile applications, so that a mobile task can be delegated by direct invocation of a service. However, developing these kind of mobile cloud applications requires to integrate and consider multiple aspects of the clouds, such as resource-intensive processing, programmatically provisioning of resources (Web APIs) and cloud intercommunication. To overcome these issues, we have developed a Mobile Cloud Middleware (MCM) framework, which addresses the issues of interoperability across multiple clouds, asynchronous delegation of mobile tasks and dynamic allocation of cloud infrastructure. MCM also fosters the integration and orchestration of mobile tasks delegated with minimal data transfer. A prototype of MCM is developed and several applications are demonstrated in different domains. To verify the scalability of MCM, load tests are also performed on the hybrid cloud resources the detailed performance analysis of the middleware framework shows that MCM improves the quality of service for mobiles and helps in maintaining soft-real time responses for mobile cloud applications. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Service oriented modeling and simulation (M&S) is being pursued by many nations and organizations. Approaches being taken span from the provision of M&S tools and applications via -as-a-Service cloud computing technologies to the actual construction of M&S via service oriented techniques. Often these approaches propose that new technologies are required to achieve service orientation. However, the benefits of service orientation derive from its core concepts of services, high interoperability, and loose coupling. Achieving service orientation in a High Level Architecture (HLA) context requires rethinking how federations are designed including the decomposition of simulation functionality into federates. This paper presents a federation designed in a traditional manner, illustrates how service oriented design alters the federation design, discusses the benefits and drawbacks of the two approaches, and provides possible improvements to the Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP) that may become part of the next iteration of the standard.

abstract={Recently cloud services have been evaluated by scientific communities as a viable solution to satisfy their computing needs, reducing the cost of ownership and operation to the minimum. The analysis on the adoption of the cloud computing model for eScience has identified several areas of improvement as federation management and interoperability between providers. Portability between cloud vendors is a widely recognized feature to avoid the risk of lock-in of users in proprietary systems, a stopper to the complete adoption of clouds. In this paper we present a programming framework that allows the coordination of applications on federated clouds used to provide flexibility to traditional research infrastructures as clusters and grids. This approach allows researchers to program applications abstracting the underlying infrastructure and providing scaling and elasticity features through the dynamic provision of virtualized resources. The adoption of standard interfaces is a basic feature in the development of connectors for different middlewares ensuring the portability of the code between different providers. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) has been one of the most commonly used clinical diagnostic tools in cardiology. However, 12-lead ECG and its management system cannot meet the demands of ECG interoperability, nor can it help facilitate real-time ECG tele-consultation services and the clinical diagnostic supporting system. Therefore, it is vital to develop a new ECG management system which serves to solve the aforementioned problems. This study applied mobile and cloud computing to establish a basic framework of 12-lead ECG information system. This system allows ECG to be operated in picture archiving communication system (PACS) with the standard, digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM), which facilitates both data and system interoperability across hospitals around the globe. In addition, this study proposed a structured format in accordance with DICOM-ECG, which includes the cardiologist's qualitative and quantitative ECG measurement reports. The proposed structured reports can be compiled as the databank for big data analysis and the development of intelligent diagnostic supporting system. This system is proved to be secure and convenient to use. In conclusion, this system facilitates data and system interoperability among hospitals, promotes ubiquitous tele-consultation, improves telemedicine services, and paves the foundation to develop an intelligent 12-lead ECG diagnostic supporting system.},

abstract={The interoperability of services and the sharing of health data have been a continuous goal for health professionals, patients, institutions, and policy makers. However, several issues have been hindering this goal, such as incompatible implementations of standards (e.g., HL7, DICOM), multiple ontologies, and security constraints. Cross-enterprise document sharing (XDS) workflows were proposed by Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) to address current limitations in exchanging clinical data among organizations. To ensure data protection, XDS actors must be placed in trustworthy domains, which are normally inside such institutions. However, due to rapidly growing IT requirements, the outsourcing of resources in the Cloud is becoming very appealing. This paper presents a software proxy that enables the outsourcing of XDS architectural parts while preserving the interoperability, confidentiality, and searchability of clinical information. A key component in our architecture is a new searchable encryption (SE) scheme - Posterior Playfair Searchable Encryption (PPSE) - which, besides keeping the same confidentiality levels of the stored data, hides the search patterns to the adversary, bringing improvements when compared to the remaining practical state-of-the-art SE schemes. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Body area networks (BANs) are emerging as enabling technology for many human-centered application domains such as health-care, sport, fitness, wellness, ergonomics, emergency, safety, security, and sociality. A BAN, which basically consists of wireless wearable sensor nodes usually coordinated by a static or mobile device, is mainly exploited to monitor single assisted livings. Data generated by a BAN can be processed in real-time by the BAN coordinator and/or transmitted to a server-side for online/offline processing and long-term storing. A network of BANs worn by a community of people produces large amount of contextual data that require a scalable and efficient approach for elaboration and storage. Cloud computing can provide a flexible storage and processing infrastructure to perform both online and offline analysis of body sensor data streams. In this paper, we motivate the introduction of Cloud-assisted BANs along with the main challenges that need to be addressed for their development and management. The current state-of-the-art is overviewed and framed according to the main requirements for effective Cloud-assisted BAN architectures. Finally, relevant open research issues in terms of efficiency, scalability, security, interoperability, prototyping, dynamic deployment and management, are discussed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Cloud computing is an emerging IT paradigm proving cost reduction and flexibility benefits. However security and privacy are serious issues challenging its adoption and sustainability in both social and commercial areas. Public clouds, in particular, present a controversial which is brought up by the need to exchange critical and protected data (even sensitive) between heterogeneous domains that are governed by multiple legislation. Access control is one of the essential and traditional security arms of data protection. However, in the context of open and dynamic environments such as clouds, access control becomes more complicated. This is because the security policies, models and related mechanisms have to be defined across various security domains and enforced in an integrated manner as required. Thus, improving the current access control paradigms is crucial in order to ensure privacy compliance in open and heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we propose a framework that is driven by legislation and which aims to assure an access control that preserves privacy while dealing with personal data hosted in public clouds. In addition, the proposed framework deals with the problem of interoperability between heterogeneous policies governing the processing of personal data on a cloud environment. In this regards, the need for access control delegation is also presented and tackled.},

Meanwhile, several trends have gained momentum, notably open education, cloud computing or the web of linked data as a realization of the Semantic Web. Educational repositories should encompass all these trends to maintain high levels of service. This paper proposes a set of best practices to the Spanish Learning Object repository Agrega, aiming to improve on its current retrieval, interoperability and reuse capabilities. As a guiding principle, the user's perspective and needs are given priority. The most recent learning technologies and semantic web standards are considered in this approach, including ISO/IEC MLR, LRMI and RAMLET metadata specifications.

abstract={Cloud services have become state of the art of resource sharing and interoperability among different service providers. The federated cloud seek to reduce costs and maximize efficiency, provide flexible and reliable services composed of various external cloud service and internal services, but this would introduce a risk of security due to outsourcing. For organization which provide an integrity cloud service must rely on SLA to illustrate the capacity of risk and performance, the various providers involved in the federations or services compositions should effectively distribute the organizational responsibilities and SLA. To solve the fears and deal with the threats associated with outsourcing, new method for selection of outsourcing cloud service providers(CSP) based on assessment of security and performance is urgently needed. This paper presents an approach on how to select the proper CSP to guarantee organizational SLA, which quantify the SLA terms and calculate a security weight, the organization can choose the appropriate CSP based on security weight, meanwhile minimize the business cost. This paper make contribution on modeling the capacity of the CSP, considering the business cost and historical performance. The proposed approach is validated through case study that shows selected CSP through our approach can best meet the organizational security and cost needs. © 2014 SERSC.},

The ability to move the services from one to another provider in a simpler manner is the definition of the cloud service portability, as an open research area which deserves more attention. In this paper we propose a new cloud portability service platform and we give an overview of the current trends in the area of cloud service portability, especially analyzing the TOSCA's approach. Our new platform proposal is based on establishing an adapter model,which offers the desired cloud portability. The new solution describes the services by a XML TOSCA approach aiming to build a custom Platform as a Service (PaaS) that can accept and exchange installations of any portable application. The scenario for the new approach assumes that the applications are described by appropriate installation requirements and application structure using the TOSCA specificationandthe platform performs the necessary installation according to the specificationto continue with automatic deployment of application/services. © 2014 The Authors.

abstract={The communication bandwidth from pelagic fishing vessel to shore was unable to cope with the increasing needs of smart devices and sensors on vessel. Fog computing and cloud computing were combined to solve this problem effectively in operating system of pelagic fishing vessel. Cloud computing could be used as the basic framework of system. Fog computing could be used as model in the local area network and sensor network on vessel. This mixed computing architectures could effectively play the advantages of each other and have a complementary effect. In research, cloud computing was taken as basic framework of operating system of pelagic fishing vessel, and service-oriented architecture service component was used to provide a reliable and safe data storage center, which could reduce the equipment requirements for client and share data and applications between different devices. There were two sources for service components. One part came from the encapsulation of original system function and was released through the network via the standards such as simple object access protocol, web services description language, universal description discovery and integration, et al.. It could effectively protect the investment. Other parts were new service components facing new requirements, which were packaged by extensible web service and supported open, dynamic interoperability model. The standard cloud computing framework increased the demand for network bandwidth. For the data volume of firmware update and message sent by sensors occupied larger proportion of communications from vessel to shore, this paper also studied equipment firmware distribution mechanism and shipboard sensor network computation model based on fog computing in order to reduce ship shore data traffic. With the aid of computing and storage capacity of shipboard equipment, the firmware distribution mechanism changed the traditional way that each device got update files from the cloud directly, pushed and updated the firmware between smart devices and sensors in local area network of vessel. This paper also studied shipboard sensor network computation model based on fog computing. For shore-based command center just was focused on changes or change tendency of message sent by sensors, the system could reduce the amount of data transmission by send filtered date only. Smart devices with computing and storage capacity could be used to select and calculate message data before they were sent to cloud by sensors in vessel, which reduced the amount of communication with high monitoring accuracy. Practice has proved that cloud-fog mixed computing architectures could not only ensure interactive integration of information from vessel to shore, but also significantly reduce the requirement for data communication bandwidth and the network traffic. During the practice period, from March 15 to May 31 in 2014, the data volume of firmware update file of smart devices and sensors was 250.905 MB, the actual firmware update communication flow was 37.175 MB. Firmware update data decreased to 14.81% of the traditional architecture. At the same time, the data volume of cumulative message produced by 27 temperature sensors was 571.63 MB, and the actual data volume of message sent from vessel to shore was 27.16 MB after selection and calculation, so message data volume reduced to 4.75%. In this period, about $7500 were saved. According to this calculation, each boat can save communication cost by $36 000 each year and the costs of communication were markedly reduced. The empirical research obtained obvious effect on a pelagic fishing vessel named Kaifu. ©, 2014, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.},

abstract={Cloud manufacturing is emerging as a novel business paradigm for the manufacturing industry, in which dynamically scalable and virtualised resources are provided as consumable services over the Internet. A handful of cloud manufacturing systems are proposed for different business scenarios, most of which fall into one of three deployment modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud, and public cloud. One of the challenges in the existing solutions is that few of them are capable of adapting to changes in the business environment. In fact, different companies may have different cloud requirements in different business situations; even a company at different business stages may need different cloud modes. Nevertheless, there is limited support on migrating to different cloud modes in existing solutions. This paper proposes a Hybrid Manufacturing Cloud that allows companies to deploy different cloud modes for their periodic business goals. Three typical cloud modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud and public cloud are supported in the system. Furthermore, it enables companies to set self-defined access rules for each resource so that unauthorised companies will not have access to the resource. This self-managed mechanism gives companies full control of their businesses and boosts their trust with enhanced privacy protection. A unified ontology is developed to enhance semantic interoperability throughout the whole process of service provision in the clouds. A Cloud Management Engine is developed to manage all the user-defined clouds, in which Semantic Web technologies are used as the main toolkit. The feasibility of this approach is verified through a group of companies, each of which has complex access requirements for their resources. In addition, a use case is carried out between customers and service providers. This way, optimal service is delivered through the proposed system. © 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.},

abstract={DoD, government agency, and commercial information technology systems are rapidly evolving from isolated enclaves to fully interoperable, net-centric, cloud-based enterprise systems where the vast amount of available data on which to make decisions is overwhelming end-users (e.g., mission commanders, operators and analysts). Many of these data are not useful for the mission at hand and must be extracted from the mission-relevant information before end-users can make decisions. These end-users seek a solution that allows them to observe relevant information in a timely manner and then to use this information to appropriately respond through information exploitation. This paper proposes a new and innovative solution to the above challenges that enables end-users to make timely mission decisions using a Cloud-based Mission Observation, Response, and Exploitation (CMORE) System that includes a mobile situational awareness (SA) console to identify information and to determine the correct response to mission events through information exploitation over the cloud. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The rise of virtualized and distributed infrastructures has led to new challenges to accomplish the effective use of compute resources through the design and orchestration of distributed applications. As legacy, monolithic applications are replaced with service-oriented applications, questions arise about the steps to be taken in order to maximize the usefulness of the infrastructures and to provide users with tools for the development and execution of distributed applications. One of the issues to be solved is the existence of multiple cloud solutions that are not interoperable, which forces the user to be locked to a specific provider or to continuously adapt applications. With the objective of simplifying the programmers challenges, ServiceSs provides a straightforward programming model and an execution framework that helps on abstracting applications from the actual execution environment. This paper presents how ServiceSs transparently interoperates with multiple providers implementing the appropriate interfaces to execute scientific applications on federated clouds. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Traditional hospital based care cannot meet all the needs of chronic diseases care in home, especially for elderly people. A new approach applying eHealth that supports interoperable health care is required. To find a way to meet the new needs, we firstly carried out a questionnaire to analyze current problems and needs in chronic disease care. Then we compared possible technical solutions and proposed a cloud model for the identified problems. This model would help chronic patients self-record and control their daily care data, communicate with other patients who have the similar situation. The proposed solution could be also used to integrate data from different healthcare providers for a cooperative work, namely in this paper as Home-based Chronic Diseases Healthcare (HCDH). © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Modeling & Simulation as a Service (MSaaS) is a concept that potentially offers all kinds of possibilities to support M&S users and providers. For many reasons service-based approaches are considered to be very promising architectures for realizing next generation simulation environments. The combination of service-based approaches with ideas taken from cloud computing is known as "Modeling & Simulation as a Service". Over the past year, NATO Modeling and Simulation Group MSG-131 ("Modelling and Simulation as a Service: New concepts and Service Oriented Architectures") has investigated the concept of MSaaS and collected national perspectives and experiences regarding MSaaS. The resulting "Multi-National Concept for M&S as a Service" provides an overview about the nations' activities in this area and is input to "NATO M&S as a Service Concept" that is currently being developed by NATOs Allied Command Transformation (ACT). This paper presents the most recent results of NATO MSG-131 Specialist Team in the area of MSaaS and related national results from research and development activities. It illustrates potential benefits that may be achieved by MSaaS and challenges that remain to be solved. National experiences with service-based distributed simulation environments are reported.

abstract={This paper introduces an approach for seamless plug & play data integration in a novel urban logistics concept. The logistics concept is called ubiquitous logistics and contains an agent-based perspective on shared logistics resources. Each private and public vehicle participating in the concept, as well as parcels, features an intelligent agent that may request (or offer) information services to other agents or legacy systems. The technical approach of this paper suggests that each of the heterogeneous data sources delivers additional information that is used to virtually integrate the data in an automated way. This additional information concerns, the authentication, data structure and sequence - information that have to be provided manually nowadays. The technical approach is explained using a typical situation from the future urban logistics concept. This situation represents an intelligent agent trying to deliver small goods along a stream of urban commuters. Copyright © 2014 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications.},

abstract={The advent of Cloud Computing opened new opportunities in several areas, namely in the application development processes. As consequence, nowadays, PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) service model allows simpler and flexible deployment strategies of applications, avoiding the need for dedicated networks, servers, storage, and other services. Within this context, several PaaS providers exist in the market, but each one having specific characteristics, proprietary technologies and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Based on such assumptions, this work addresses the challenge of devising a PaaS aggregation solution with the objective of unifying the information and management processes of applications created in PaaS environments. The proposed solution, denominated as PaaS Manager, take the form of a PaaS API aggregator aiming to struggle the existing lock-in in the PaaS market. In this perspective, this paper describes the specification, development and test of the proposed PaaS Manager solution. As result of this framework, end-users are able to select the most appropriate PaaS platform for an application, interacting with any supported vendor through a unique deployment and management interface. © 2014, ComSIS Consortium.

abstract={Content Distribution Networks are mandatory components of modern web architectures, with plenty of vendors offering their services. Despite its maturity, new paradigms and architecture models are still being developed in this area. Cloud Computing, on the other hand, is a more recent concept which has expanded extremely quickly, with new services being regularly added to cloud management software suites such as OpenStack. The main contribution of this paper is the architecture and the development of an open source CDN that can be provisioned in an on-demand, pay-as-you-go model thereby enabling the CDN as a Service paradigm. We describe our experience with integration of CDNaaS framework in a cloud environment, as a service for enterprise users. We emphasize the flexibility and elasticity of such a model, with each CDN instance being delivered on-demand and associated to personalized caching policies as well as an optimized choice of Points of Presence based on exact requirements of an enterprise customer. Our development is based on the framework developed in the Mobile Cloud Networking (MCN) EU FP7 project, which offers its enterprise users a common framework to instantiate and control services. CDNaaS is one of the core support components in this project as is tasked to deliver different type of multimedia content to several thousands of users geographically distributed. It integrates seamlessly in the MCN service life-cycle and as such enjoys all benefits of a common design environment, allowing for an improved interoperability with the rest of the services within the MCN ecosystem. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={As Internet Protocol (IP) enabled space architectures are promulgated in order to achieve enhanced interoperability, resiliency, and affordability, it is important to consider space cyber implications of these open architectures. No longer do we have security by obscurity", since future space systems open themselves up to the malware population of the Internet. In many ways, the space enterprise becomes more similar to terrestrial information technology (IT) enterprises, and it is anticipated that government space enterprises will become further inspired by commercial, civil, and international space architectures as well as by Internet technology. This would require space systems to develop increased levels of cyber situational awareness. This would imply the prudent working assumption that not all components and data of the space systems can be fully trusted. Self protection would require increased levels of local autonomy and self awareness of various space systems. Space architectures will require the use of protection firewalls, as well as considerable computational capacity, in order to execute algorithms that detect intrusions, and employ immunological and other approaches to protect the space enterprise. This will include pervasive monitoring of key parts of the enterprise, as well as the deployment of appropriate autonomic procedures, with humans on the loop, providing oversight of the higher semantic levels. It is anticipated that future advances in this area, including the incorporation of cloud computing and big data on clouds, would offer both challenges as well as solutions to these issues.},

abstract={The digital convergence of IT, Network and Content produced during the last years has created a new landscape for the definition and delivery of ICT services to citizens. The massive introduction of hypervisors and virtualisation techniques has allowed the (self-service) provision of any resource (software, network, data) in a seamless way to Users and Applications. The term Future Internet was coined in EU to synthesize these concepts and refer to the novel architectures enabling the next generation of Internet applications. The digital convergence includes also the so-called embedded systems that through Gateways connected to the Internet to provide a technical bridge to interact with sensors and actuators. This paper introduces the initial findings from experimental work done in the context of ClouTa, a EU-funded project aiming at defining and developing a common virtualisation layer, allowing the access and management of IoT devices, as well as Cloud Services, in the same way as any other data. The authors demonstrate and provide a simple way to design and implement a real infrastructure that satisfies the following requirements: cheap, easy to maintain, open source based, compatible and interoperable with different platforms and services. It is an example of how to make a public or a private Cloud capable of hosting data that comes from different kinds of sensors. Moreover this architecture allows the interconnection of all devices (Internet of Things, IoT) and its implementation is illustrated in detail.

abstract={Applications of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies require availability and access to an information technology (IT) infrastructure and bioinformatics tools for large amounts of data storage and analyses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) anticipates that the use of NGS data to support regulatory submissions will continue to increase as the scientific and clinical communities become more familiar with the technologies and identify more ways to apply these advanced methods to support development and evaluation of new biomedical products. FDA laboratories are conducting research on different NGS platforms and developing the IT infrastructure and bioinformatics tools needed to enable regulatory evaluation of the technologies and the data sponsors will submit. A High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment, or HIVE, has been launched, and development and refinement continues as a collaborative effort between the FDA and George Washington University to provide the tools to support these needs. The use of a highly parallelized environment facilitated by use of distributed cloud storage and computation has resulted in a platform that is both rapid and responsive to changing scientific needs.

abstract={The U.S Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has built a â€œ Network Science Research Labâ€ to support research that aims to improve their ability to analyze, predict, design, and govern complex systems that interweave the social/cognitive, information, and communication network genres. Researchers at ARL and the Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance (NS-CTA), a collaborative research alliance funded by ARL, conducted experimentation to determine if automated network monitoring tools and task-aware agents deployed within an emulated tactical wireless network could potentially increase the retrieval of relevant data from heterogeneous distributed information nodes. ARL and NS-CTA required the capability to perform this experimentation over clusters of heterogeneous nodes with emulated wireless tactical networks where each node could contain different operating systems, application sets, and physical hardware attributes. Researchers utilized the Dynamically Allocated Virtual Clustering Management System (DAVC) to address each of the infrastructure support requirements necessary in conducting their experimentation. The DAVC is an experimentation infrastructure that provides the means to dynamically create, deploy, and manage virtual clusters of heterogeneous nodes within a cloud computing environment based upon resource utilization such as CPU load, available RAM and hard disk space. The DAVC uses 802.1Q Virtual LANs (VLANs) to prevent experimentation crosstalk and to allow for complex private networks. Clusters created by the DAVC system can be utilized for software development, experimentation, and integration with existing hardware and software. The goal of this paper is to explore how ARL and the NS-CTA leveraged the DAVC to create, deploy and manage multiple experimentation clusters to support their experimentation goals. © 2014 SPIE.},

abstract={There are many examples of GIS application in planning such as urban land-use planning, cultural heritage conservation, coastal zone management, and the design of structure plans for sustainable economic development. All these applications are dealing with systems in which natural and human factors are interconnected. But an issue that should be addressed is to what extent the current information technology is able to connect all these parts together? Contemporary improvement in information technology made the computer so imbedded in our everyday practices that we use it without having to think about it. Thus, computing is becoming truly ubiquitous and is available anywhere anytime. Advances in the internet facilities and devices, such as high speed wireless networks, mobile middleware, and smart technologies, has pushed the concept of ubiquitous computing to the forefront of GIS research and development. There are developments in this regards, these are such as GeoWeb 2.0, voluntarily geographic Information (VGI), and Mashups, whereby the application of cloud computing was possible in visualizing urban air pollution and emergency responses to ensure the safety and security. These advancements therefore, have changed the conventional facet of macro and micro spatial planning. Every possible information system such as residential, medical, business, environmental, governmental, and the like can be linked through ubiquitous computing technologies and acts as a virtually one system which works for society. However, the journey to achieve a true ubiquitous GIS is not without challenges. Despite the current potentials there are many issues and obstacles need to be addressed before GIS can to be truly ubiquitous in planning context. Perhaps four criteria as explained by Goodchild et al (1997) can be applied to ubiquitous GIS in planning very well: the system must be distributed (data storage, processing and user interaction can occur at locations that are potentially widely scattered), disaggregated (the monolithic systems are replaced by 'plug and play' components designed to interoperate through conformance with industry-wide standards), decoupled (system must be able to access a number of components over many networks required to complete a specific task) and, interoperable (system is based on an "open" system). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Data and Internet services have become ubiquitous, and the recent trend of building massive cloud datacenters is part of the current network evolution. The success of Internet of Things (IoT) will not so much depend on the development of new technologies, but rather on connecting and integrating existing resources. The paper proposes a novel architecture that enables objects to exchange information through the Internet to achieve nonintrusive behavior and customized services based on an open source cloud platform. To achieve this goal, the information driven interactions are done not only in a peer to peer method, but also via advanced cloud services. The result is a generic platform where devices, systems and services will take part in a heterogeneous and decentralized architecture. We demonstrate that IoT is all about interoperability, from connected cloud computing using RFID, NFC, M2M and sensor technology to digital content and context-aware services. We conclude our cloud of things vision by expanding on the need for interoperability of cloud and IoT. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The original Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) model was developed in the early 90's, with revisits in 1998, and 2004. Today, with new technologies of big data, cloud computing, and machine analytics, there is an ever increasing need for integration of people and machines. The original JDL model focused on the data fusion (correlation, filtering, and association) issues, while today there is an increasing emphasis on an integrated approach to information exploitation over sensors, users, and missions using enterprise architectures, interoperability standards, and intelligence to the edge. Given these recent changes to computation and distributed access, we examine ways for extending the JDL model from 1998 to support exploitation functions and information management for situation awareness, massive data analytics for contextual awareness, and domain-specific needs for mission awareness. © 2013 ISIF ( Intl Society of Information Fusi.},

abstract={The underlying principles of open source software are 'openness' and interoperability. The licensing infrastructure ensures that these values will be preserved. However, the ideology may be under threat in the networked era. Cloud computing is a maturing technology practice whose success is contingent on utilizing open source software. Open source licences apply when software is distributed - mere running or making available does not trigger the protection. The new licence, Affero GPL, aims to prevent a potential proprietary lock-in in the cloud. This article argues that the attempt is futile. The freedom to modify software may be relevant for hobbyists, not for the majority of commercial enterprises. In the current technology set-up the values of open source worth preserving are accessibility, interoperability, and re-usability. And these will not be saved thanks to a licensing scheme, but thanks to an open and flexible architecture.},

abstract={The different implementations of cloud computing services developed by each cloud vendor have resulted in a heterogeneity of APIs and libraries which most developers of cloud-based applications must fight to understand. This so called vendor lock-in effect leads to a substantial increment on the development effort required to switch the initially selected cloud service used by an application to a different one. Different initiatives have emerged to solve this problem, such as standardization attempts, and intermediate systems or middlewares. Instead, our approach makes use software adaptation techniques for tackling the vendor lock-in problem and facilitating the development of cloud applications that are not coupled to any specific platform. In this paper, a case study application is presented in order to illustrate how the vendor lock-in effect appears and to make an estimation of the effort required for its migration to a different platform. This way we show the benefits of our approach for reducing the cloud service migration efforts. Such solution is sketched briefly, and the main steps of the adaptation process are described. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Big data storage is a considerable challenge for IT organizations. Cloud providers promote using cloud storage for this purpose. However, vendor lock-in problem prevents organizations to migrate toward cloud storage. An evident solution is to distribute redundant data across multiple cloud providers in order to increase the probability of access to data. This paper analyses such a solution that uses erasure coding as a method of distribution. We study the effect of system parameters such as failure rate, redundancy ratio and number of initial block on data access. We show that the probability of access to data varies logarithmically in terms of time and number of initial block. Further increasing redundancy ratio is not always effective. © 2013 IEEE.},

In order to provide more stable and advanced services for the future, greater interoperability has become a target for developers. In this study, we focused on four key capabilities in the search for greater interoperability: scalability, universality, continuity, and specialty. Cloud computing can only be considered interoperable to the extent that it incorporates these four issues. Assessing these issues comprises the methodology we propose to verify the interoperability of cloud computing architecture. Also, in order to effectively assess and implement the methodology described in this paper, there must be a stringent and detailed process of preparation, with regards to full implementation and institutionalization.© 2013 SERSC.},

abstract={Cloud computing generally involves the use of data storage and computational resources from external providers. Although a number of commercial providers are currently on the market, it is often beneficial for a user to consider capability from a number of different ones. This would prevent vendor lock-in and more economic choice for a user. Based on this observation, work on 'Social Clouds' has involved using social relationships formed between individuals and institutions to establish Peer-2-Peer resource sharing networks, enabling market forces to determine how demand for resources can be met by a number of different (often individually owned) providers. In this paper we identify how trading within such a network could be enhanced by the dynamic emergence (or identification) of brokers-based on their social position in the network (based on connectivity metrics within a social network). We investigate how offering financial incentives to such brokers, once discovered, could help improve the number of trades that could take place with a network. A social score algorithm is described and simulated with PeerSim to validate our approach. We also compare the approach to a distributed dominating set algorithm-the closest approximation to our approach. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing as a service-on-demand architecture has grown in importance over the previous few years. One driver of its growth is the ever increasing amount of data which is supposed to outpace the growth of storage capacity. The usage of cloud technology enables organizations to manage their data with low operational expenses. However, the benefits of cloud computing come along with challenges and open issues such as security, reliability and the risk to become dependent on a provider for its service. In general, a switch of a storage provider is associated with high costs of adapting new APIs and additional charges for inbound and outbound bandwidth and requests. In this paper, we present a system that improves availability, confidentiality and reliability of data stored in the cloud. To achieve this objective, we encrypt user's data and make use of the RAID-technology principle to manage data distribution across cloud storage providers. We conduct a proof-of-concept testbed experiment for our application to evaluate the performance and cost effectiveness of our approach. We deployed our application using eight commercial cloud storage repositories in different countries. Our approach allows users to avoid vendor lock-in, and reduces significantly the cost of switching providers. We also observed that our implementation improved the perceived availability and, in most cases, the overall performance when compared with individual cloud providers. Moreover, we estimated the monetary costs to be competitive to the cost of using a single cloud provider. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the main obstacles hindering wider adoption of storage cloud services is vendor lock-in, a situation in which large amounts of data that are placed in one storage system can not be migrated to another vendor, e.g., due to time and cost considerations. To prevent this situation we present an advanced on-boarding federation mechanism, enabling a cloud to add a special federation layer to efficiently import data from other storage clouds. This is achieved without being dependent on any special function from the other clouds. We design a generic, modular on-boarding architecture and demonstrate its implementation as part of a VISION Cloud, which is a large scale storage cloud designed for content-centric data. Our system is capable of integrating storage data from various clouds, providing a common global view of storage data. The users can access the data through the new cloud provider immediately after the setup, maintaining the normal operation of applications, so that they do not need to wait for the completion of the data migration process. Finally, we analyze the payment models of existing storage clouds, showing that transferring the data via on-boarding federation with a direct link between clouds can lead to significant time and cost savings. © 2013 IEEE.},

This protocol separates the network view of service information and the application view of service information when exchanging service information to support interoperability and it uses multicast at various point of protocol to support scalability. Cloud system may have a lot of services and users to communicate with each other. Hence, there are some needs for effective transfer method and the multicast is one of the ideal solutions for this problem.

abstract={The demand for large-scale systems running in complex and even chaotic environments requires the consideration of new paradigms and technologies that provide flexibility, robustness, agility and responsiveness. Multiagents systems is pointed out as a suitable approach to address this challenge by offering an alternative way to design control systems, based on the decentralization of control functions over distributed autonomous and cooperative entities. However, in spite of their enormous potential, they usually lack some aspects related to interoperability, optimization in decentralized structures and truly self-adaptation. This paper discusses a new perspective to engineer adaptive complex systems considering a 3-layer framework integrating several complementary paradigms and technologies. In a first step, it suggests the integration of multi-agent systems with service-oriented architectures to overcome the limitations of interoperability and smooth migration, followed by the use of technology enablers, such as cloud computing and wireless sensor networks, to provide a ubiquitous and reconfigurable environment. Finally, the resulted serviceoriented multi-agent system should be enhanced with biologically inspired techniques, namely self-organization, to reach a truly robust, agile and adaptive system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) offers the promise of integrating the digital world of the Internet with the physical world in which we live. But realizing this promise necessitates a systematic approach to integrating the sensors, actuators, and information on which they operate into the Internet we know today. This paper reports the design and development of an open community-oriented platform aiming to support federated sensor data as a service, featuring interoperability and reusability of heterogeneous sensor data and data services. The concepts of virtual sensors and virtual devices are identified as central autonomic units to model scalable and context-aware configurable/reconfigurable sensor data and services. The decoupling of the storage and management of sensor data and platform-oriented metadata enables the handling of both discrete and streaming sensor data. A cloud computing-empowered prototyping system has been established as a proof of concept to host smart community-oriented sensor data and services. © 2013 IEEE.},

Additionally, it was introduced the "thin device" concept which allows to move the traditional ticketing operations to cloud platform, allowing that way to increase elasticity and interoperability issues. The device created is a prototype of this validation ticketing device with the validation services in a cloud platform (Amazon Web Services). Physically, the prototype consists in validator running on a tablet with Android operating system, but the validation logic remains out of the device in a service basis.

abstract={Roll-out of future cloud systems will be influenced by regulations from the standardisation bodies, if made available across the community. Trends in cloud deployment, operation and management to date have not been guided by any regulatory standards, and resources have been deployed in an ad hoc manner as demanded according to the business objectives of service providers. This is the least costly and most quickly revenue-returning business model. It is not however, the most cost-effective approach on a long-term basis: As a consequence of this roll-out model to date, the interoperability of resources deployed across clouds managed by different operators is restricted through inability to allocate workload to them in a regulated and controllable manner. The absence of standardised approaches to cloud management is therefore beginning to be accommodated such that the cost and performance advantages of interoperable operation may be exploited. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in standards across the field and trends in their development. We present a model which defines the drivers for cloud interoperability and constraints which restrict the extent to which this may realistically occur in future scalable solutions. This is supplemented with discussion on future challenges foreseen with regard to cloud operation and the way in which standards require provision such that cloud interoperation may be accommodated. © 2013 The Science and Information Organization.},

abstract={The popularity of teleradiology services has enabled a major advance in the provision of health services to areas with difficult geographical access. However, this potential has also brought with it a number of challenges: the large volume of data, characteristic of imaging tests, and security requirements designed to ensure confidentiality and integrity. Moreover, there is also a number of ethical questions involving the dominant model on the market, whereby this service is outsourced to private companies, and is not directly undertaken by professional radiologists. Therefore, the present paper proposes a cooperative model of teleradiology, where health professionals interact directly with the hospitals providing patient care. This has involved the integration of a wide range of technologies, such as the interconnection models Peer-to-Peer, Cloud Computing, Dynamic DNS, RESTful Web Services, as well as security and interoperability standards, with the aim of promoting a secure, collaborative asynchronous environment. The developed model is currently being used on an experimental basis, providing teleradiology support to cities in the north-eastern hinterland of Brazil, and is fulfilling all expectations. © 2013 IMIA and IOS Press.},

abstract={This paper provides an update and extension of a 2005 paper on The Future of Systems and Software Engineering Processes. Some of its challenges and opportunities are similar, such as the need to simultaneously achieve high levels of both agility and assurance. Others have emerged as increasingly important, such as the opportunities and challenges of dealing with smart systems involving ultralarge volumes of data; with multicore chips; with social networking services; and with cloud computing or software as a service. The paper is organized around eight relatively surprise-free trends and two wild cards whose trends and implications are harder to foresee. The eight surprise-free trends are: 1. Increasing emphasis on rapid development and adaptability; 2. Increasing software criticality and need for assurance; 3. Increased complexity, global systems of systems, and need for scalability and interoperability; 4. Increased needs to accommodate COTS, software services, and legacy systems; 5. Smart systems with increasingly large volumes of data and ways to learn from them; 6. Increased emphasis on users, social networking services, web applications, and end value; 7. Computational plenty and multicore chips; 8. Increasing integration of software and systems engineering. The two wild-card trends are: 9. Increasing software autonomy; and 10.

abstract={The transition to cloud computing requires a certain effort since the development of applications for the Cloud requires programming skills and knowledge about the several programming models, APIs provided by Cloud vendors and cloud patterns to fit the cloud environment. Due to the lack of sharing programming model and interface also the porting of application among clouds requires in most case the rewriting of the whole application according to the new provider interface and programming model. The growing number of cloud providers that deploy their offers led to increase more and more the need to automate some discovery mechanisms and alignment facilities. In this paper a possible solution to the above stated problem is proposed through the application of semantic and matchmaking technologies. In particular we want to describe the Dynamic Discovery and Mapping prototype, developed within the EU funded mOSAIC project (http://www.mosaic-cloud.eu), to provide the discovery of new Cloud services (dynamically) deployed by providers. The Dynamic Discovery and Mapping Service' target is to discover Cloud providers' functionalities and resources, compare and align to other provider or agnostic API, thus supporting agnostic and interoperable access to Cloud providers' offers. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={The city is a privileged place from which to analyze the emergence of new social demands and conflicts. Informational and ecological paradigms of contemporary urban landscape collect them in an ideal type called, in many scientific and policy perspectives, Smart City. To be economically competitive, socially developed and culturally modern, cities have to face sustainability and digital innovation challenges. This involves implementing new technologies and organizational architectures in both sectors: recycle, zero energy buildings, car sharing as well as broadband, cloud computing services, and accessibility. Often these elements are not isolated: ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) research is increasingly focused on the improvement of environmental outputs. The convergence between technologies is directly linked with the emergence of new social practices and cultural acquisitions. Digital innovation, ecological issues and integrated solutions populate the policy agenda of many European cities, often overcoming political belongings, generating new life styles. You can project zero energy buildings because you have 3D Digital Software, but you use it to save energy because we are aware of environmental risks. The key topic of this paper is communication understood as collective and connective intelligence able to solve problems, an immaterial infrastructure linked with material and human capitals able to change the network of power between sub social systems. To be still functional, sub social systems should increase interoperability and decrease auto-reference. In essence it means creating a platform where citizen, firms, and public administrations share data, opinions and information. It requires expanding the opportunity for everyone to be connected, to widen participation, to increase openness and interoperability. What is the shape of this platform What consequences would produce her implementation in the organization of power To what extent is the Smart City Model politically naive. © Common Ground, Claudio Marciano, All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Software certification has been successfully used with traditional 'static' software. With the introduction of new computing paradigms such as service-oriented computing and cloud computing, the existing way to represent software certifications based in verbose human-oriented documents, exhibits many limitations, to the point of making the approach not useful in practice. The ASSERT4SOA project is currently addressing this problem and has developed a computer-oriented representation for software certifications based on a new type of digital certificates called ASSERT. However, in order to be able to represent the huge heterogeneity of certification schemes and standards, the ASSERT specification has to be extremely flexible and rather complex. This in turn, makes the production of ASSERTs difficult, and moreover, limits their interoperability, as to be interoperable, ASSERTS need to follow certain rules. This paper presents the solution adopted in the project in order to improve the interoperability of independently produced ASSERTS. The solution has been evaluated and has received very positive feedback. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Building Information Modeling (BIM) for optimizing the total lifecycle cost of buildings is a challenge even today. Inadequate software interoperability, high costs as a result of the fragmented nature of the building industry, lack of standardization, inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders are just some of the obstacles that architects and engineers face. However, optimization requires a structured procedure that enables continuous changes in design variables and assessment on energy consumption. A holistic building design and construction are already introduced in Europe through the energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD). The requirements have been strengthened by the EPBD recast for achieving cost optimal building designs for the life cycle of the building, moving towards nearly zero energy buildings by the end of the decade. BIM and intelligent services could play a crucial role in these efforts with improved visualization and productivity due to easy retrieval of information, increased coordination of data and exchange of information, all leading to a reduced cost for the design of energy efficient buildings. An ongoing European research project aims to contribute to these needs by developing a Virtual Energy Laboratory that will support building energy performance simulations taking into account the stochastic nature of input parameters and processes. This will be supported by information communication technology features utilizing the necessary computational power through cloud computing. This paper presents an overview of the ongoing efforts and focuses on results for assessing the impact of different input weather and climate data that are pertinent in building load and energy performance calculations. © Balaras et al.},

abstract={The increasing demand of services delivery in existing heterogeneous e-learning systems is a hot research issue. In order to enable the interoperability, we propose a solution based on cloud computing technology for instant building and delivering new services composed of existing web services discovered through UDDI or web services marketplace. In this paper, we present our approach to solve integration problems between heterogeneous e-learning systems. A larger variety of e-learning providers and requesters will be connected through a broker. Then, we expose our research in modeling services composition with a support of quality of service properties. Thus a model based on extension of Petri-nets aims to transform the operational semantics of service composition framework. In fact, this paper suggests this model to the analysis of web services composition in order fully match different users' request. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents the system developed to promote the rational use of electric energy among consumers and, thus, increase the energy efficiency. The goal is to provide energy consumers with an application that displays the energy consumption/production profiles, sets up consuming ceilings, defines automatic alerts and alarms, compares anonymously consumers with identical energy usage profiles by region and predicts, in the case of non-residential installations, the expected consumption/production values. The resulting distributed system is organized in two main blocks: front-end and back-end. The front-end includes user interface applications for Android mobile devices and Web browsers. The back-end provides data storage and processing functionalities and is installed in a cloud computing platform - the Google App Engine - which provides a standard Web service interface. This option ensures interoperability, scalability and robustness to the system. © 2013 AISTI.},

abstract={In the view of semantic heterogeneity among ontologies, this paper presents a semantic similarity calculation method based on the grammar itself and the structure of concept in order to achieve inter-ontology mapping efficiently and gives an example to validate the mapping process. The results show that the algorithm can get semantic similarity between the two concepts in different ontologies and find the mapping relationship. The mapping method can help solve the problems of semantic heterogeneity, strengthen interoperability between ontologies, and contribute to the standardization establishment of knowledge systems. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Many studies have indicated that computing technology can enable off-site cardiologists to read patients' electrocardiograph (ECG), echocardiography (ECHO), and relevant images via smart phones during pre-hospital, in-hospital, and post-hospital teleconsultation, which not only identifies emergency cases in need of immediate treatment, but also prevents the unnecessary re-hospitalizations. Meanwhile, several studies have combined cloud computing and mobile computing to facilitate better storage, delivery, retrieval, and management of medical files for telecardiology. In the future, the aggregated ECG and images from hospitals worldwide will become big data, which should be used to develop an e-consultation program helping on-site practitioners deliver appropriate treatment. With information technology, real-time tele-consultation and tele-diagnosis of ECG and images can be practiced via an e-platform for clinical, research, and educational purposes. While being devoted to promote the application of information technology onto telecardiology, we need to resolve several issues: (1) data confidentiality in the cloud, (2) data interoperability among hospitals, and (3) network latency and accessibility. If these challenges are overcome, tele-consultation will be ubiquitous, easy to perform, inexpensive, and beneficial. Most importantly, these services will increase global collaboration and advance clinical practice, education, and scientific research in cardiology. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to present a cloudlet architecture for dashboard in Cloud and Ubiquitous Manufacturing. In practice means that, with Cloud Computing adoption, Manufacturing requires management applications where ubiquity and effectiveness are enabled. If ubiquity and resources scalability, availability and capacity can be well supported by cloud, pragmatics instruments are required to support effectiveness. The architecture here presented shows the integration of enriched existing (cloud) services, as instances of resources, with layers of new services towards direct and synchronous communication between users. These Rich Internet Application (RIA) components, here named cloudlets, integration, follow dashboards organization patterns and will be supported by emergent web3.0 interaction technologies. In fact, the paper proposes a new Presentation Layer to be used in UMS and (that may be used) in any multi-layer cloud-based web application.},

abstract={With the ever-changing dynamic Information and Communications Technology environment and the new shared deployment options for computing, a paradigm shift is occurring that enables ubiquitous and convenient computing on a pay-as-you-go basis. Access on demand is becoming available to networks of scalable, elastic, self-serviceable, configurable physical and virtual resources. On a more narrowly focused IT and business front, there is a parallel shift towards designing information systems in terms of the services available at an interface. The Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) development style is based on the design of services and processes and the realization of interoperability and location transparency in context-specific implementations. This paper analyzes the Cloud Computing and SOA Reference Architectures being developed by ISO ISO/IEC JTC1 SC38 (in collaboration with ITU-T SG13/WP6 for Cloud Computing), and offers a concept comparison using Fact Based Modeling (FBM) methodology. FBM has allowed us to distill the concepts, relationships and business rules - thereby exposing the strengths and weakness of each, and identifying the gaps between the two. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Mobile cloud computing has grown out of two hot technology trends, mobility and cloud. The emergence of cloud computing and its extension into the mobile domain creates the potential for a global, interconnected mobile cloud computing environment that will allow the entire mobile ecosystem to enrich their services across multiple networks. We can utilize significant optimization and increased operating power offered by cloud computing to enable seamless and transparent use of cloud resources to extend the capability of resource constrained mobile devices. However, in order to realize mobile cloud computing, we need to develop mechanisms to achieve interoperability among heterogeneous and distributed devices. We need solutions to discover best available resources in the cloud servers based on the user demands and approaches to deliver desired resources and services efficiently and in a timely fashion to the mobile terminals. Furthermore, while mobile cloud computing has tremendous potential to enable the mobile terminals to have access to powerful and reliable computing resources anywhere and anytime, we must consider several issues including privacy and security, and reliability in realizing mobile cloud computing. In this chapter, the authors first explore the architectural components required to realize a mobile cloud computing infrastructure. They then discuss mobile cloud computing features with their unique privacy and security implications. They present unique issues of mobile cloud computing that exacerbate privacy and security challenges. They also discuss various approaches to address these challenges and explore the future work needed to provide a trustworthy mobile cloud computing environment. © 2014, IGI Global.},

abstract={In recent years, the rise and rapid adoption of cloud computing has acted as a catalyst for research in related fields: virtualization, distributed and service-oriented computing to name but a few. Whilst cloud computing technology is rapidly maturing, many of the associated long-standing socio-technical challenges including the dependability of cloud-based service composition, services manageability and interoperability remain unsolved. These can be argued to slow down the migration of serious business critical applications to the cloud model. This paper reports on progress towards the development of a method to generate cloud-based service compositions from requirements metadata. The paper presents a formal approach that uses Situation Calculus to translate service requirements into an Intention Workflow Model (IWM). This IWM is then used to generate autonomic cloud service composition. The Petshop benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the proposed method. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a novel, rapidly growing segment in the Cloud computing market. However, the diversity and heterogeneity of today's existing PaaS offerings raises several interoperability challenges. This introduces adoption barriers due to the lock-in issues that prevent the portability of data and applications from one PaaS to another, "locking" software developers to the first provider they use. This paper introduces the Cloud4SOA solution, a scalable approach to semantically interconnect heterogeneous PaaS offerings across different Cloud providers that share the same technology. The design of the Cloud4SOA solution, extensively presented in this work, comprises of a set of interlinked collaborating software components and models to provide developers and platform providers with a number of core capabilities: matchmaking, management, monitoring and migration of applications. The paper concludes with the presentation of a proof-of-concept implementation of the Cloud4SOA system based on real-life business scenarios. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The benefits of counting with a high number of providers for developing cloud applications are overshadowed by the vendor lock-in issue, which makes it difficult for service-based applications to be migrated and replicated in new platforms. The MULTICLAPP framework tackles this issue by providing a three stage development process for building multicloud applications where developers do not require specific expertise on cloud technologies. The application modeling stage is described in this paper, where a UML profile is used for modeling applications in a platform independent manner. Multicloud applications are modeled as a composition of software artefacts, where each can be assigned to a different platform. This provides an intuitive way of modeling applications, and when integrated in the MULTICLAPP framework, makes it easier for them to be developed, maintained and redeployed in different platforms. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The essential issue of interoperability in distributed systems is becoming even more pressing in the Future Internet, where complex applications will be composed from extremely heterogeneous systems. Open system integration paradigms, such as service oriented architecture (SOA) and enterprise service bus (ESB), have provided answers to the interoperability requirement. However, when it comes to integrating systems featuring heterogeneous interaction paradigms, such as client-service, publish-subscribe and tuple space, existing solutions are typically ad hoc and partial, applying to specific interaction protocol technologies. In this paper, we introduce an interoperability solution based on abstraction and merging of the common high-level semantics of interaction paradigms, which is sufficiently general and extensible to accommodate many different protocol technologies. We apply this solution to revisit the SOA- and ESB-based integration of heterogeneous distributed systems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The concept behind cloud computing is to facilitate a wider distribution of hardware and software based services in the form of a consolidated infrastructure of various computing enterprises. In practice, cloud computing could be seen as an environment that combines cluster and grid characteristics that have been integrated into a single setting. Currently, cloud computing resources are limited in interoperability, mainly because of the homogeneity and the coherency of their resources. However, the number of users demanding cloud services has increased dramatically, thus, the need for collaborative clouds has increased as well. Therefore, various cases arise from this concerning the scalability and customisability when managing multi-tenancy. Here, we present an algorithmic model for managing the interoperability of the cloud environment, namely inter-cloud. So, we integrate our theoretical approach from the scope of orchestrating job execution in a distributed setting. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Computer forensics involves the collection, analysis, and reporting of information about security incidents and computer-based criminal activity. Cloud computing causes new challenges for the forensics process. This paper addresses three challenges for network forensics in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) environment: First, network forensics needs a mechanism for analysing network traffic remotely in the cloud. This task is complicated by dynamic migration of virtual machines. Second, forensics needs to be targeted at the virtual resources of a specific cloud user. In a multi-tenancy environment, in which multiple cloud clients share physical resources, forensics must not infringe the privacy and security of other users. Third, forensic data should be processed directly in the cloud to avoid a costly transfer of huge amounts of data to external investigators. This paper presents a generic model for network forensics in the cloud and defines an architecture that addresses above challenges. We validate this architecture with a prototype implementation based on the OpenNebula platform and the Xplico analysis tool. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Security engineering for any given application can usually be done in many different ways. There is often a tradeoff between usability (including efficiency) and the level of protection offered. Typically the risks are assessed by developers, and a particular approach is chosen, with the assumption that the design can stay fixed for some time. Adoption of Cloud computing will challenge the viability of this approach. Beyond the extra difficulties faced when doing security engineering within distributed systems, Cloud providers require a different threat model from self-hosted resources. They are best considered "trusted but curious" even if the curiosity is accidental on the Cloud provider's part. Some threats from such Cloud providers can be confounded through the use of cryptography, but doing so is overkill in terms of the performance penalty for many applications. To acquire the benefits of Cloud computing while minimising security risks, we believe that application developers should be provided with the ability to dynamically change the security enforcement technology in use by their software, balancing performance and security as they see fit. Recent cryptography research will significantly increase our ability to offer a runtime choice of contrasting security enforcement approaches without needing to modify the security policy. We present our initial research into this area, and outline our vision for the future. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Cloud-based applications are built from services offered by distinct third-party cloud providers. Most cloud-related information (service properties such as price, availability, response time, etc.) can change at any time during application execution. Therefore, it is essential to support the adaptation of applications in such dynamic conditions in order to ensure that the cloud services currently provided to deployed applications adhere to the established requirements. In this paper we present an autonomous adaptation process for cloud-based applications by replacing a service by an alternative one that fulfills the application needs. We discuss the factors that trigger an adaptation in a Cloud Computing scenario and describe the adaptation process within Cloud Integrator, a service-oriented middleware platform for composing, executing, and managing services provided by different cloud platforms. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Despite the fact that cloud computing offers a high degree of dynamism on resource provisioning, there is a general lack of support for managing dynamic adaptations of replicated services in the cloud, and, even when such support exists, it is focused mainly on elasticity by means of horizontal scalability. We analyse the benefits a replicated service may obtain from dynamic adaptations in the cloud and the requirements on the replication system. For example, adaptation can be done to increase and decrease the capacity of a service, move service replicas closer to their clients, obtain diversity in the replication (for resilience), recover compromised replicas, or rejuvenate ageing replicas. We introduce FITCH, a novel infrastructure to support dynamic adaptation of replicated services in cloud environments. Two prototype services validate this architecture: a crash fault-tolerant Web service and a Byzantine fault-tolerant key-value store based on state machine replication. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

Classical solutions are a real burden to setup statically and their cost are prohibitive in terms of human and hardware resources. Cloud computing brings new opportunities to stress application scalability as load testing solutions can be provided on demand by the cloud. This paper describes a Benchmark-as-a-Service solution that scales automatically the load injection platform and eases its setup according to load profiles. Our approach is based on: (i) the virtualization of the Benchmarking platform to enable the injector's self-scalability, (ii) an online calibration mechanism to characterize injector capacity and impact on the benched application, (iii) a provisioning solution to scale the load injection platform sufficiently ahead of time. We also report experiments on a benchmark that shows the benefits in terms of cost and resources savings. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={NoSQL databases were initially devised to support a few concrete extreme scale applications. Since the specificity and scale of the target systems justified the investment of manually crafting application code their limited query and indexing capabilities were not a major impediment. However, with a considerable number of mature alternatives now available there is an increasing willingness to use NoSQL databases in a wider and more diverse spectrum of applications and, to most of them, hand-crafted query code is not an enticing trade-off. In this paper we address this shortcoming of current NoSQL databases with an effective approach for executing SQL queries while preserving their scalability and schema flexibility. We show how a full-fledged SQL engine can be integrated atop of HBase leading to an ANSI SQL compliant database. Under a standard TPC-C workload our prototype scales linearly with the number of nodes in the system and outperforms a NoSQL TPC-C implementation optimized for HBase. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Developing software for the cloud usually implies using the tools and libraries supplied by cloud vendors for each of their platforms. This strongly couples the software to specific platforms and penalizes its migration or interoperability with external cloud services, in what is known as vendor lock-in. Under these circumstances multicloud applications become difficult to build and maintain since they require multidisciplinary teams with expertise on multiple platforms, and the redevelopment of some components if the cloud deployment scenario is altered. The MULTICLAPP framework described in this paper tackles these issues by presenting a three-stage development process that allows multicloud applications to be developed without being coupled to any concrete vendor. MDE and adaptation techniques are used throughout the software development stages in order to abstract the software from each vendor's service specifications. As a result of this, multicloud applications or their subcomponents can be reassigned to different cloud platforms without having to undergo a partial or complete redevelopment process. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={The evolution of ICT towards fast and robust data exchange promoted the blooming of successful technical and business concepts like cloud computing and virtualisation of enterprise assets. The escalation of service providers enabled the specialisation of enterprises (particularly SMEs) and the building of provider networks. This move from enterprise-concentric to service-dispersed strategies is leading to concerns about reaching and maintaining the interoperability between customer-provider pairs and their associated business networks. This is particularly true in the aerospace industry: a highly-competitive and demanding business supported by numerous applications, which may be general-purposed, specific, proprietary or open-sourced, all needing to be interoperable with the lowest impact on the business itself. This paper addresses the need for improving the sustainability of enterprise interoperability via the application of negotiations, with the objective of reducing the impact of changes and achieving the best solutions in the interoperability between the enterprises and their surrounding environment.

abstract={Cloud computing transforms the way Information Technology (IT) is consumed and managed, promising improved cost efficiencies, accelerated innovation, faster time-to-market, and the ability to scale applications on demand (Leighton, 2009). According to Gartner, while the hype grew exponentially during 2008 and continued since, it is clear that there is a major shift towards the cloud computing model and that the benefits may be substantial (Gartner Hype-Cycle, 2012). However, as the shape of cloud computing is emerging and developing rapidly both conceptually and in reality, the legal/contractual, economic, service quality, interoperability, security, and privacy issues still pose significant challenges. In this chapter, the authors describe various service and deployment models of cloud computing and identify major challenges. In particular, they discuss three critical challenges: regulatory, security, and privacy issues in cloud computing. Some solutions to mitigate these challenges are also proposed along with a brief presentation on the future trends in cloud computing deployment. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Today's applications are often constructed by bringing together functionality from multiple systems that utilize varied technologies (e.g. application programming interfaces, Web services, cloud computing, data mining) and alternative standards (e.g. XML, RDF, OWL, JSON, etc.) for communication. Most such applications achieve interoperability via the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), the de facto document standard for information exchange in domains such as library repositories, collaborative software development, health informatics, etc. The use of a common data format facilitates exchange and interoperability across heterogeneous systems, but challenges in the aspect of security arise (e.g. sharing policies, ownership, permissions, etc.). In such situations, one key security challenge is to integrate the local security (existing systems) into a global solution for the application being constructed and deployed. In this chapter, the authors present a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) security framework for XML, which utilizes extensions to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) policies that target XML schemas and instances for any application, and provides both the separation and reconciliation of local and global security policies across systems. To demonstrate the framework, they provide a case study in health care, using the XML standards Health Level Seven's (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and the Continuity of Care Record (CCR). These standards are utilized for the transportation of private and identifiable information between stakeholders (e.g. a hospital with an electronic health record, a clinic's electronic health record, a pharmacy system, etc.), requiring not only a high level of security but also compliance to legal. © 2014 by IGI Global.

abstract={Cloud interoperability is a new problem that is becoming evident as more cloud providers offer competing clouds and more enterprises migrate their applications into the cloud environments. However, for large enterprises the problem lies in enterprise software and middleware non-interoperability and overall complexity more than in the cloud providers incurred issues. In this paper we analyze cloud interoperability issues for existing enterprise applications based on our substantial enterprise IT transformation experience. We believe that adoption of stricter enterprise application development and maintenance policies and their enforcement coupled with PaaS clouds' quick middleware provisioning and configuration capabilities will allow easy, predictable, fast, and inexpensive application rebuilds on-demand. This, in turn, will allow much cheaper application transformations, adoption of new technologies, and migrations between various clouds and non-cloud environments. We evaluate our policies based on three real-life applications from large corporations and show that strict application documentation and standardization results in at least an order of magnitude cost reduction of cloud application migrations.},

abstract={Migrating services to the cloud brings all the benefits of elasticity, scalability and cost-cutting. However, migrating services among different cloud infrastructures or outside the cloud is not an obvious task. In addition, distributing services among multiple cloud providers, or on a hybrid installation requires a custom implementation effort that must be repeated at each infrastructure change. This situation raises the lock-in problem and discourages cloud adoption. Cloud computing open standards were designed to face this situation and to bring interoperability and portability to cloud environments. However, they target isolated resources, and do not take into account the notion of complete services. In this paper, we introduce an extension to OCCI in order to support complete service definition and management automation. We support this proposal with an open-source framework for service management through compliant cloud infrastructures.},

We propose therefore the evolution of the traditional architecture of ticketing system for a cloud based architecture in which the core processes of ticketing are offered through a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model, which can be subscribed by operators that pay-per-use. Ticketing device (e.g. gates, validators, ticket vending machines) are integrated in the cloud environment. This approach is achieved by moving business logic from terminals to the cloud. Each terminal is registered to be managed by each own operator, configuring a multi-tenant implementation which is vendor hardware independent, allowing to address elasticity and interoperability issues. The elasticity of the cloud will support the expansion/implosion of small (transport) operators business around electronic ticketing. In the near future, this ticketing solution will promote collaboration between transport operators.},

abstract={Cloud service offerings provide a competitive advantages to enterprises through flexible and scalable access to computing resources. With the recent advances in Cloud computing, the need is emerging for interoperability between Cloud services so that a complex and developed business applications on Clouds are interoperable. In fact, combining different independent Cloud services necessitates a uniform description format that facilitatesthe design, customization, and composition. In this context, Agent Interaction Protocols (IP) are a useful way for structuring communicative interaction among business partners, by organizing messages into relevant contexts and providing a common guide to the all parts. The challenge here is twofold. First, we must propose a formal model that is rich enough to capture interactions characteristics. Second, we must allow designers to combine existing protocols to achieve a new specific need. The work presented in this paper is considered as a first step toward Agent Interaction Protocols as a Service. In fact, we propose a basis for a theoretical approach for aggregating protocols to create a new desired business application. The proposed approach provides the underpinnings of aggregation abstractions for protocols. Also, it proposes a set of operators that allows the creation ofnew value-added protocols using existing ones as building blocks. © 2013 SCPE.},

Lack of data interoperability standards and solutions has been a major obstacle in the exchange of healthcare data between different stakeholders. We propose an EHR system - cloud health information systems technology architecture (CHISTAR) that achieves semantic interoperability through the use of a generic design methodology which uses a reference model that defines a general purpose set of data structures and an archetype model that defines the clinical data attributes. CHISTAR application components are designed using the cloud component model approach that comprises of loosely coupled components that communicate asynchronously.

This technology helps decrease capital expenditure and operation costs, solve scalability issue and many more user and provider constraints. However, development and deployment of distributed applications on cloud environment becomes a more and more complex task. Cloud users must spend a lot of time to prepare, install and configure their applications on clouds. In addition, after development and deployment, the applications almost cannot move from one cloud to another due to the lack of interoperability between them. To address these problems, in this paper we present a novel development and deployment framework for cloud distributed applications/services. Our approach is based on abstraction and object-oriented programming technique, allowing users to easily and rapidly develop and deploy their services into cloud environment. The approach also enables service migration and interoperability among the clouds.},

abstract={Each year, a number of natural disasters strike across the globe, killing hundreds and causing billions of dollars in property and infrastructure damage. Minimizing the impact of disasters is imperative in today's society. As the capabilities of software and hardware evolve, so does the role of information and communication technology in disaster mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery. A large quantity of disaster-related data is available, including response plans, records of previous incidents, simulation data, social media data, and Web sites. However, current data management solutions offer few or no integration capabilities. Moreover, recent advances in cloud computing, big data, and NoSQL open the door for new solutions in disaster data management. In this paper, a Knowledge as a Service (KaaS) framework is proposed for disaster cloud data management (Disaster-CDM), with the objectives of 1) storing large amounts of disaster-related data from diverse sources, 2) facilitating search, and 3) supporting their interoperability and integration. Data are stored in a cloud environment using a combination of relational and NoSQL databases. The case study presented in this paper illustrates the use of Disaster-CDM on an example of simulation models. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that provides agility to align technical solutions to a modular business Web Services (WS) that are well decoupled from their consumers. This agility is extended to the Cloud model. To achieve a high level of security and a degree of decoupling, SOA encourages the use of standardized transport schemes such as SOAP/HTTP(s) with WS family of standards specifications (commonly referred to as WS-* (WS-star)) to ease the interoperability complexity and security concerns in enterprise networks, which have medium/high bandwidth and reliable/wired networks. However, these protocol standards are ill suited for mobile devices due to their limited computational capabilities, low bandwidth, and intermittent connectivity. In this paper, we present an analysis of WS-* standards, classifying and discussing their inter-dependencies to provide a basis for determining the limitation of mobile device use in SOA and for establishing an architectural consideration baseline for selecting appropriate security mechanisms. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing as a service-on-demand architecture has grown in importance over the previous few years. One driver of its growth is the ever increasing amount of data which is supposed to outpace the growth of storage capacity. In this way public cloud storage services enable organizations to manage their data with low operational expenses. However, the benefits of cloud computing come along with challenges and open issues such as security, reliability and the risk to become dependent on a provider for its service. In general, a switch of a storage provider is associated with high costs of adapting new APIs and additional charges for inbound and outbound bandwidth and requests. In this paper, we describe the design, architecture and implementation of Cloud-RAID, a system that improves availability, confidentiality and integrity of data stored in the cloud. To achieve this objective, we encrypt user's data and make use of the RAID-technology principle to manage data distribution across cloud storage providers. The data distribution is based on users' expectations regarding providers geographic location, quality of service, providers reputation, and budget preferences. We also discuss the security functionality and reveal our observations on the utility and users benefits from using our system. Our approach allows users to avoid vendor lock-in, and reduce significantly the cost of switching providers. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={System of Systems (SoS) architectures have been used to conceptually define complex systems. However, very few SoS architectures have been physically realized to solve real-world problems. Proposed in this work is the full realization of a net-centric SoS architecture used to implement and integrate a complex system used to automate human detection from an image source. A SoS architecture was selected to implement the human detection system due to a SoS's ability to achieve high levels of interoperability. This high level of interoperability is feasible via standardization of communication and by structuring information to conform to a proposed XML framework. Additionally, each individual system within the SoS hierarchy is functionally decomposed based on sets defined services that each system requires and provides. Moreover, a new concept of a commonly implemented directory service is used to initialize system communication and automate SoS architecture discovery. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The emergence of Systems of Systems Engineering (SoSE) poses challenges to the consistent use of terminology within and/or across heterogeneous sectors such as transport, energy and defence. In preparation for Horizon 2020, an €80 billion financial instrument running from 2014 to 2020 to implement the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Commission funded T-AREA-SoS project to formulate a strategic research agenda for SoSE that spans US and Europe activities. As part of T-AREA-SoS, a thesaurus will be created to ensure that SoS concepts and terms are consistently interpreted, and to provide an artefact that will be of significant assistance to planners of future programmes in SoSE. This paper proposes an approach for the formalisation and mapping of terminologies for a SoSE thesaurus development.

abstract={Whilst cloud computing has burst into the current scene as a technology that allows companies to access high computing rates at limited costs, cloud vendors have rushed to provide tools that allow developers to build software for their cloud platforms. The software developed with these tools is often tightly coupled to their services and restrictions. Consequently vendor lock in becomes a common problem which multiple cloud users have to tackle in order to exploit the full potential of cloud computing. A scenario where component-based applications are developed for being deployed across several clouds, and each component can independently be deployed in one cloud or another, remains fictitious due to the complexity and the cost of their development. This paper presents a cloud development framework for developing cloud agnostic applications that may be deployed indifferently across multiple cloud platforms. Information about cloud deployment and cloud integration is separated from the source code and managed by the framework. Interoperability between interdependent components deployed in different clouds is achieved by automatically generating services and service clients. This allows software developers to segment their applications into different modules that can easily be deployed and redistributed across heterogeneous cloud platforms. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, we leverage the previous work on the SHIWA bundling format and expand on this specification in order to facilitate workflow execution within a multi-workflow environment. We introduce a scalable and robust execution pool environment that supports workflows consisting of sub-workflows built upon a multitude of different workflow engines and environments, and also provide a common workflow representation for seamless connectivity through serialization to workflow bundles. We also present a meta-workflow scenario based upon this system. Workflow bundles employ the lightweight Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) Web-based standard, to provide a common format for representing and sharing workflows and the associated metadata required for their execution. This generalized bundling approach is already available within five workflow engines and has proven a useful environment for inter-workflow experimentation. The execution pool facilitates federated access to multiple distributed computing infrastructures supported by the underlying workflow engines subscribed to the pool. Workflow bundles are exposed using the eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which provides the necessary communication backbone to enable multiple workflow engine agents to asynchronously publish and subscribe to bundles in meta-workflow pipelines. We present experiments showing the scalability and robustness of the pool execution approach with results showing that overheads remain controlled for up to 150 workflow agents, and that agent failures have very limited impact. We then demonstrate the applicability of our architecture by describing how a Java-based music analysis workflow can be distributed within such a multi-workflow environment consisting of the Triana and MOTEUR workflow engines. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This paper presents on-going research to develop the Intercloud Architecture Framework (ICAF) that addresses problems in multi-provider multi-domain heterogeneous cloud based infrastructure services and applications integration and interoperability, to allow their on-demand provisioning. The paper refers to existing standards and ongoing standardisation activity in Cloud Computing, in particular, recently published NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (CCRA) and ITU-T JCA-Cloud activity. The proposed ICAF defines four complementary components addressing Intercloud integration and interoperability: multi-layer Cloud Services Model that combines commonly adopted cloud service models, such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, in one multilayer model with corresponding inter-layer interfaces, Intercloud Control and Management Plane that supports cloud based applications interaction, Intercloud Federation Framework, and Intercloud Operations Framework. The paper briefly describes the Service delivery and lifecycle management as an important ICAF component that provides a basis for consistent management and security of the provisioned on-demand complex cloud based services. The paper describes an implementation of the Intercloud Control and Management Plane in the GEYSERS project to allow optimal provisioning of the combined Network+IT resources in the inter-cloud environment. The proposed architecture is intended to provide an architectural model for developing Intercloud middleware and in this way will facilitate clouds interoperability and integration. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Semantic Interoperability is one of the most important open challenges in the Knowledge Management field. In this work, we propose a framework for making easier information exchanging operations among heterogeneous information sources, over the Cloud. Exploiting the Semantic Web technologies, the framework has the objective of allowing semantic interoperability among distributed software agents preserving not only semantics of transmitted messages, but also the subjectivity of agent's world vision in the communication process. The proposed system, in fact, will help users in the digital documents exchanging activities by extracting the related relevant information and coding their informative contents in a shape capable of preserving the original semantics, also in the case of communications agents using different or incompatible vocabularies. The framework is a an evolution of semantic interoperable methodologies towards cloud computer technologies, thus guaranteeing several advantages in terms of usability, scalability and fault tolerance. In particular, we implemented a prototype that provides interoperability functionalities in the E-Health domain, managing information coming from heterogeneous sources. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Applications used to evaluate next-generation electrical power grids ("smart grids") are anticipated to be compute and data-intensive. In this work, we parallelize and improve performance of one such application which was run sequentially prior to the use of our cloud-based configuration. We examine multiple cloud computing offerings, both commercial and academic, to evaluate their potential for improving the turnaround time for application results. Since the target application does not fit well into existing computational paradigms for the cloud, we employ parallel scripting tool, as a first step toward a broader program of adapting portable, scalable computational tools for use as enablers of the future smart grids. We use multiple clouds as a way to reassure potential users that the risk of cloud-vendor lock-in can be managed. This paper discusses our methods and results. Our experience sheds light on some of the issues facing computational scientists and engineers tasked with adapting new paradigms and infrastructures for existing engineering design problems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing facilitates the new generation of IT and the provisioning of services by introducing virtualization concepts throughout the network. Multi-tenancy introduces the capability to share cloud assets among service users. Service providers currently lack innovative means to enable true multi-tenancy in a cloud environment. There is an urgent need for technologies that introduce tenant security, traffic identification and tenant separation for better billing and fairness. This paper introduces a technology that tackles all these requirements by defining the concept of a Tenant-ID that is incorporated into the OSI Layer 2 frame header. We outline the concept of Tenant-IDs, the adapted 802.1q header and a way to automatically configure tenants via Cloud automation tools and software-defined networking approaches. The paper concludes by outlining interoperability to relevant layer-2 protocols and by introducing use-cases benefiting from the Tenant-ID concept. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The 21st century started with some significant efforts globally in the e-health sector. This was mainly pushed as a generic strategy from many nations and international organizations in order to cope with issues such as ageing population, demographic shift, social security limitations, and financial instability. A second reason was the introduction of new technologies such as cloud computing, Web interoperability standards, mobile health, and social media that are steadily changing the way healthcare has been seen in the last decades. In addition to that, globalization, commuting, immigration, and increased mobility raised the issue of cross-border healthcare and the right to access normalized healthcare services anywhere, anytime. In that context, the authors analyze the technological offerings and result of the epSOS (European Patient Smart Open Services) framework and how it has affected strategic decisions in electronic prescription in Greece, thus creating a new useful e-health national application. They prove that by rethinking healthcare, reusing established standards such as HL7 CDA (Health Level Seven Clinical Document Architecture) and IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) profiles, it is possible to propose a new innovative system that is in fact based upon new technological propositions such as REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture and cloud computing. © 2014, IGI Global.},

abstract={In the last few years the broad diffusion of Cloud Computing has encouraged the proliferation of cloud computing providers. However, providers often propose their services using proprietary management software, interfaces and virtualization technologies. This strongly hinders the applications interoperability and migration across providers boundaries. Organizing providers in federations seems promising for addressing such issues, but it introduces other challenges to be faced, often requiring innovative approaches. Unfortunately, the evaluation of new solutions in a repeatable manner and under several configurations is a hard task to achieve using real Clouds platforms. For these reasons we propose SmartFed, a simulator for cloud federations that is able to model the richness typical of an environment with multiple cloud providers. We show the capability of SmartFed by simulating a sample mapping process for assigning applications to providers. © 2013 ACM.},

The paper discusses several techniques known from already existing price comparison engines that could be modified and adopted for comparison of cloud providers. A technique for filtering measured data is proposed, in particular to avoid vendor lock-in issues. The paper presents a design and results from an engine for simulation of various ranking algorithms in response to streams of prices from various providers. Examples with various streams of provider prices and resulting rankings are presented that cope with the vendor lock-in issue as well as consider the impact of long or short-term price changes on the ranking.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a revolution in the information technology industry. It allows computing services provided as utilities. The traditional cloud services include Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Hardware/Infrastructure as a Service, and Database as a Service. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Ontology as a Service (OaaS), whereby the ontology tailoring process is a service in the cloud. This is particularly relevant as we are moving toward Cloud 2.0 - multi-cloud providers to provide an interoperable service to customers. To illustrate OaaS, in this paper we propose sub-ontology extraction and merging, whereby multiple sub-ontologies are extracted from various source ontologies, and then these extracted sub-ontologies are merged to form a complete ontology to be used by the user. We use the Minimum extraction method to facilitate this. A walkthrough case study using the UMLS meta-thesaurus ontology is elaborated, and its performance in the cloud is also discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Sensors and actuators are the fundamental constituents of a cyber physical system (CPS). Pervasiveness of the sensors, requirement of collaborative processing of data, historical importance of data, and the ever increasing different forms of user applications are not only making data management more complex, but are also bringing more challenges for the scalability of a CPS. On the other hand, the requirement of bringing actuators to complete the feedback loop of a CPS is making it even more complex. There are three stages of complexities associated with scalability: in the physical infrastructure of the data acquisition system, in the communication mechanism, and in the server and user applications. In all these stages, diversity, interoperability and individual capacity limitations of components play an important role in establishing the overall scalability limits of the CPS. In this paper we will systematically study how these parameters affect the scalability limits. Furthermore, we will also study the existing technologies (e.g. of big data and cloud) which can be used for addressing the challenges of scalability imposed at different stages of futuristic cyber physical systems. © Indian Institute of Science.},

For science and engineering parallel or distributed applications, on-demand access to resources within grids and clouds is hampered by two major factors: communication performance and paradigm mismatch issues. We propose a framework for addressing the latter aspect via software adaptations that attempt to reconcile model and interface differences between application needs and resource platforms. Such matching can greatly enhance flexibility in choice of execution platforms-a key characteristic of utility computing-even though they may not be a natural fit or may incur some performance loss.

abstract={Cloud computing is a new paradigm that allows users to access computing resources in a dynamic, flexible and scalable manner. It has drawn the interest of multiple users, and in a short period of time it has experienced a notorious hype. However, its numerous strengths are mitigated by the lack of standardization which the technology suffers from. Different cloud vendors provide and manage similar resources in a different manner, thereby coupling the application to its targeted cloud. Companies that consume cloud services are locked-in to a single cloud vendor due to the high costs of migrating software in the cloud, preventing them from changing their cloud provider or having multiple providers. In this paper we explore a solution to the cloud vendor lock-in problem based on the use of model-driven engineering and software adaptation techniques. The proposed solution is both cloud vendor and user friendly as it allows the former to freely define their own cloud policies, whilst users continue to be free to choose a cloud provider, even after the application has been developed.},

abstract={Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a rapidly growing IT paradigm which enables software developers to deploy applications without the burden of software platform maintenance. Currently, the PaaS market is dominated by a few providers that promote incompatible standards. This introduces adoption barriers that prevent the interoperability between heterogeneous PaaS offerings, so software developers are not able to manage distributed applications spanning multiple public/private clouds. In this paper we present a multi-PaaS application management solution as a result of the Cloud4SOA European project that addresses these challenges. To clarify this approach a distributed deployment and cloud bursting scenarios are used. © 2013 SCPE.},

abstract={Cloud computing has seen a tremendous growth in the last five years. Along with the growth, many cloud models have been marketed. They deliver hardware and software as virtualization enabled services to users. Although cloud computing offers considerable advantages such as unlimited resources, manageability and lower investment costs but there are still barriers to exploit it. One of the barriers is the difficulties, which users are being faced when developing and deploying their own services into clouds. In this paper, we present a novel approach for developing interoperable services that can be deployed in different cloud infrastructures at the same time. The approach provides an instrument with emphasis on abstraction, inheritance and code reuse. Using the approach, cloud-based services are developed easily by extending existing abstractions classes provided by the instrument or other developers. The interoperability between different clouds is solved via the basic abstraction class of the instrument and all services are inherited and benefited from this advantage. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm that allowsusers with different computing demands to access a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., servers, network, storage, database, applications and services). Many commercial cloud providers have emerged in the past 6-7 years, and each typically provides its own cloud infrastructure, APIs and application description formats to access the cloud resources, as well as support for service level agreements (SLAs). Such vendor lock-in has seriously limited the flexibility that cloud end users would like to process, when it comes to deploy applications over different infrastructures in different geographic locations, or to migrate a service from one provider's cloud to another. To enable seamless sharing of resources from a pool of cloud providers, efforts have emerged recently to facilitate cloud interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple cloud providers to work together, from both the industry and academia. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art efforts, with a focus on interoperability among different IaaS (infrastructure as a service) cloud platforms. We investigate the existing studies on taxonomies and standardization of cloud interoperability, as well as practical cloud technologies from both the cloud provider's and user's perspectives to enable interoperation. We pose issues and challenges to advance the topic area, and hope to pave a way for the forthcoming research. Copyright is held by author/owner(s).},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss issues involved in navigating the modern information environment where the relevance of cloud computing is unavoidable. This is a way of shifting from the hardware and software demands of storing and organizing data, to information access concerns. That is because with the exponential growth in information sources and all accompanying complexities, the limited capacity of libraries to host their own in its entirety necessitates opting for alternatives in the cloud. Design/methodology/approach: A review of current literature about the topic was performed Findings: Literature used reveals that currently, libraries are using the cloud for putting together user resources, i.e. using Software as a Service (SaaS), such as in library catalogues, WorldCat, Googledocs, and the aggregated subject gateways like SUMMON, and others; the web Platform as a Service (PaaS) as in the use of GoogleApp Engine; or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) as in the use of D-Space, FEDORA, and others. The cloud is confirmed as a facilitator in storing and accessing information in addition to providing a unified web presence with reduced local storage capacity challenges. Originality/value: The value of these findings is to remind librarians of the shift in focus towards which devices provide the easiest access to data and applications. This is one of the reasons they in many instances are currently having to address issues relating to the use of electronic media tools such as smartphones, iPad, e-book readers, and other handheld devices. The largely borderless information resources also bring to the forefront considerations about digital rights management, fair use, information security, ownership and control of data, privacy, scholarly publishing, copyright guidance, and licensing that the librarian has to be knowledgeable about. It has become necessary for librarians who make use of commercial cloud services to be conversant with the implications on institutional data. To avert the ever present dangers and risks involving cyber-security, it is usually practical for institutions to keep policies, procedures, fiscal, and personnel data in private clouds that have carefully crafted access permissions. Being aware of these implications enables thoughtful, adaptive planning strategies for the future of library practice and service. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

It is in the context of this problem that the authors and their colleagues, as telecom standards experts, discovered the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP). This paper describes the approach taken by the authors and their colleagues to use RM-ODP to these issues in the ITU-T study groups, how those efforts were applied and the relevance of RM-ODP to current computing systems based on the concepts of Cloud Computing.

abstract={One of the problems of the Spanish Public Health National System is the lack of interoperability in the implemented Electronic Health Records (EHRs) systems in primary and specialty care. There is a deficiency in the electronic health systems that store the data of primary care patients, so one of the basic problems that prevent that every hospital and health center working on the same method is that deficiency. In this paper we research on this problem and to give expression to a series of solutions to it. Bibliographic material in this work has been obtained mainly from MEDLINE source. Additionally, due to the lack of information and privacy about the different EHRs systems, we have resorted to making direct contact with the organizations that have implemented those systems and technological providers. Two solutions have been propounded given several aspects for a feasibility study. The first solution is based upon in the execution of backups in different EHRs databases, which implies a huge economical and infrastructure development. The second of these solutions so that due to the creation of protocols by means of Cloud Computing Technologies. It is crucial the need to reach a homogeneity concerning to the storage of patients clinical data. On the results achieved we can emphasize that maybe the main problems are not the economical handicaps or the large technological development needed, but, as for Health each Region manages its own competences, each one governs with independent policies and decisions. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

abstract={The events of September 11, 2001, the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 awakened American policymakers to the importance of the need for emergency management. This paper explains how a cloud computing environment can support social networks and logistical coordination on a global scale during crises. Basic cloud computing functionality is covered to show how social networks can connect seamlessly to work together with profound interoperability. Lastly, the benefits of a cloud computing solution is presented as the most cost-effective, efficient, and secure method of communication during a disaster response, with the unique capability of being able to support a global community through its massive scalability. © 2013, IGI Global.},

abstract={The heterogeneity of cloud semantics, technology and interfaces limits application and platform portability and interoperability, and can easily lead to vendor lock-in. We identify, analyse and classify existing solutions to cloud vendor lock-in, and highlight unresolved challenges. Our survey is based on a systematic review of 721 primary studies that describe the state-of-the-art in managing cloud lock-in, portability and interoperability. 78 of these primary studies were selected and used for a thorough analysis of cloud standards, commercial products and academic work related to cloud lock-in. Our review shows that most solutions proposed so far are platforms, APIs or architectures addressing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) interoperability. From our review, we identify a need for: (i) exploiting established solutions from areas that are closely related to cloud computing, (ii) increasing empirical evidence to raise confidence in existing solutions, and (iii) addressing the socio-technical and business challenges related to cloud lock-in. © 2013 IEEE.},

Typically, a user will choose the same provider for computation and storage to minimize latency and networking costs. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to switch providers once one is selected due to vendor lock-in [2]. Copyright © 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

abstract={Due to the heterogeneity of today's cloud providers, migrating applications between providers is extremely challenging. This lack of portability is caused, in part, by vendor lock-in: the strong dependency created between a cloud user and a cloud provider since the cloud user deploys their software on a specific cloud platform. This paper outlines our plans to address vendor lock-in by applying techniques from the area of model-driven engineering (MDE), a contemporary and principled approach to software engineering that has sometimes been used to achieve greater portability of software. This paper presents preliminary models of two widely used IaaS services and an analysis of literature reporting real cases of software migration, and introduces a research question and method for our future work on using MDE to address vendor lock-in for cloud computing. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing has been widely referred as a promising technology by the Information Technology community. The market of Cloud services expects an increase of hundreds of billions of dollars in the next years. Currently, most services are being offered by centralized datacenters over the Internet, which imposes limitations such as non-guaranteed end-to-end quality of service and relative low security. The network control owned by telecommunications providers may be considered as a major competitive differential for companies that plan to join the cloud services market. Among the different cloud service models, the Infrastructure as a Service model can be considered as the most appropriate model for telecom providers in the cloud market since it is the less complex option and it can be used as a basis for deploying the other models. In order to take advantage of their network reachability, telecom providers should consider a distributed architecture and other architectural decisions to support multi-tenancy, migration of virtual machines and prevent vendor lock-in. Another important aspect when designing cloud services is the choice of tools for deploying these services. The tools should meet as many requirements as needed in order to provide services in a proper and successful manner. This paper aims to discuss some important aspects as to serve as a reference guide for telecom providers and service providers that wish to enter the cloud services market. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Portability is key for services running in the Cloud to prevent vendor lock-in. Today, many Cloud services are portable and can thus be moved from one Cloud provider to another. However, the management of these services is often bound to provider-specific management tooling. Thus, the way of management of a particular Cloud service may completely change when moving it to another Cloud provider. This paper presents concepts to improve the portability of Cloud service topology models that are deployed and managed using scripts. We highlight the challenges of a semi-automatic procedure to generate portable TOSCA-compliant topology model components based on Juju topology model components.},

abstract={Cloud storage federation improves service availability and reduces vendor lock-in risks of single-provider cloud storage solutions. Federation therefore distributes and replicates data among different cloud storage providers. Missing controls on data location and distribution however introduce security and compliance issues. This paper proposes a novel approach of using data-driven usage control to preserve compliance constraints in cloud storage federation. Based on common compliance regulations and laws we provide a brief categorization of compliance problems into spatial, temporal, and qualitative requirements. In addition, we show how usage control policies can be employed to constrain federation according to these categories. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach we evaluate security and performance of our prototypical implementation. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Cloud Computing paradigm is used by many actors, whether companies or individuals in order to harness the power and agility of remote computing resources. Because they target developers and offer a smooth and easy way to deploy modern enterprise software without dealing with the underlying infrastructure, there is a steadily increasing interest for Platforms as a Service (PaaS). However, the lock-in makes the migration to another platform difficult. If the vendor decides to raise its prices or change its security policies, the customer may have to consider to move to the competition or suffer from these changes. Assistance and tooling to move to the competition at the PaaS layer still does not exist thus requiring tremendous re-engineering effort. In this regard, we propose an approach to the challenge of software migration between PaaS using Model-Driven Engineering coupled to Program Transformation.

abstract={Cloud computing by now has gained wide recognition in business and is becoming increasingly important for consumers. However, consumers experience uncertainties, such as security, privacy, and vendor lock-in. Certifications provide assurances and may mitigate uncertainties, making cloud service certifications a core focus of the European Union's cloud strategy and various certification programs. In this paper, we identify ten potential assurances for cloud service certifications and empirically assess their relative importance as perceived by consumers. We surveyed 53 consumers who use or intent to use consumer cloud services in a discrete choice experiment that follows the best-worst scaling (BWS) method. Results indicate that privacy, security, and availability are the three most preferred assurances, whereas process maturity, flexibility, and financial stability are the three least preferred assurances. This paper contributes to research by utilizing BWS, which - to the best of our knowledge - so far has not been used in IS research, and thereby directing attention to a promising method. By identifying and empirically ranking various quality and trust assurances for consumer cloud services, we furthermore build foundations for future research on trust-assuring arguments and quality signals for cloud services as well as provide insights for practice on designing effective cloud service certifications.},

In this paper we present a two phase chord-based peer-to-peer distributed resource discovery mechanism based on spatial-awareness of cloud data-centers belonging to different Cloud Service Providers. Exploiting location information of Data Centers by organizing them into chord-based clusters belonging to different geographic locations and connecting these clusters through a super ring chord structure allows for optimized resource discovery within acceptable latency. The proposed mechanism thus allows for QoS-compliant resource provisioning across Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Simulation results establish the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The adoption of Cloud Computing as a new business model has induced the proliferation of platform providers. However, the platform as-a-service (PaaS) concept still has several drawbacks to address before it can become widely used. In fact, PaaS involves some risks of vendor lock-in and compatibility restrictions if applications to deploy require proprietary or specific hosting frameworks such as applications based on Service Component Architecture (SCA) specifications. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to provision appropriate platform resources in order to host and deploy SCA-based applications on Cloud platforms. Our approach consists of slicing SCA-based applications to different services and then deploying them on our already developed service micro-containers. Our approach is a PaaS-independent approach that allows developers to deploy SCA-based applications on the target PaaS regardless of the platform capabilities. We motivate our solution with real use case scenario to show its feasibility. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The cloud computing paradigm promises increased flexibility and scalability. However, in private cloud environments this flexibility and scalability is constrained by the limited capacity. On the other hand, organizations are reluctant to migrate to public clouds because they lose control over their applications and data. The concept of a hybrid cloud tries to combine the benefits of private and public clouds, while also decreasing vendor lock-in. This paper presents PaaSHopper, a middleware platform for hybrid cloud applications that enables organizations to keep fine-grained control over the execution of their applications. Driven by policies, the middleware dynamically decides which requests and tasks are executed in a particular part of the hybrid cloud. We validated this work by means of a prototype on top of a hybrid cloud consisting of a local JBoss AS cluster, Google App Engine, and Red Hat OpenShift. © 2013 ACM.},

The benefits provided by Cloud-based technologies allow us to re-design new services to solve many problems afflicting e-governance and public administration in each country. In particular, one of the primarily need of Public Administration (PA) is the interoperability between the different areas and districts, which is rather complex due to the lack of standard schemes for data modeling.

The proposed model also suggests that the scale of the company may moderate the effects of above trust factors on the trust in the adoption of CIOS. The proposed trust model aims to help the cloud computing service providers to understand the trust factors that will affect users' trust in the adoption of CIOS. So that cloud computing service providers can adjust their strategies for providing successful cloud computing services. It also provides a base for further research on the trust models for the adoption of other cloud systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In cloud computing, Some Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) have their own cloud infrastructure which is centralized or geographically distributed, small or large-scale. Others act as Brokers (CSBs) who integrate and launch services based on multiple CSPs' infrastructures. How to meet the complex requirements for different scenarios while provide high quality, especially telecom grade cloud services in terms of most appropriate resource utilization, high service level assurance, operation, administration, maintenance, and security, even interoperability amongst different clouds is becoming more and more concerned. In this paper, a unified MetaScheduler architecture is proposed to address the aforementioned challenges. The functions of the components are defined and workflows for different networking scenarios are described. The detailed analysis shows that the architecture can support different scenario cloud system implementation and realize telecom grade services. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing has the promise of significant benefits that include reduced costs, improved service provisioning, and a move to a pay-per-use model. However, there also are many challenges to successfully delivering cloud-based services; including security, data ownership, interoperability, service maturity and return on investment. These challenges need to be understood and managed before attempting to take advantage of what the cloud has to offer. In this paper we introduce a nine-step cloud life cycle that can be used for both the migration and the ongoing management of public, cloud-based services. A consortium of organizations using an open-innovation approach developed the life cycle. This paper describes each step of the life cycle in terms of the key challenges faced, and the recommended activities, with resultant outputs, needed to overcome them. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

These aspects are handled on one hand by extending an existing semantic based Design pattern language in order to properly represent both Design and Cloud patterns together with its possible related architectural implementations and on the other hand by using these agnostic representations to define a mapping between Design patterns (a single design pattern or a composition of pattern) and Cloud patterns, in order to obtain a clear model of the cloud applications which could satisfy its original requirements and exploit all the benefits of cloud computing at the same time. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper takes a systematic review methodology to unearth the reason for a slow adoption of cloud computing by businesses, despite the user interests and cloud advancements gained recently. The key finding is that the IT industry has taken different modelling approaches to engineer and deliver the cloud services based on the goals of different key cloud players, thereby raising various adoption challenges and concerns. In this context, there is a need for rethinking Software Engineering concepts. This motivates us to question whether the existing Software Engineering theories and modelling principles are sufficient for the new cloud computing paradigm. Due to the paucity of a comprehensive review in literature, the main aim of this review article is to identify such research gaps and insufficiencies in Software Engineering, and to provide recommendations for bridging these gaps. In this work, the systemic review of the state of the art of cloud computing has resulted in identifying four major cloud modelling gaps that require prime attention. The paper discusses these gaps and identifies the key Software Engineering challenges prevalent in addressing each of these gaps. Finally, the author proposes five topmost research recommendations specifically designed for overcoming these gaps/ challenges in order to facilitate a sustainable cloud adoption. Overall, the author's findings have established the need to rethink Software Engineering theories for arriving at a multilateral or distributed cloud modelling approach. With such rethinking, the proposed cloud design automatically incorporates cloud user-roles, interoperability, intelligent automation and trusted cloud infrastructure strategies for achieving a sustainable cloud framework of the future.

abstract={Cloud computing and associated services are changing the way in which we manage information and access data. E-health services are not impermeable to novel technologies, especially those that involve mobile devices. At present, many patient monitoring m-health (mobile-health) platforms consist of close, vendor-dependent solutions based on particular architectures and technologies offering a limited set of interfaces to interoperate with. This fact hinders to advance in quality attributes such as customization, adaptation, extension, interoperability and even transparency of cloud infrastructure of existing solutions according to the specific needs of their users (patients and physicians). This paper presents an extensible, scalable, highly-interoperable and customizable platform called Zappa, designed to support e-Health/m-Health systems and that is able to operate in the cloud. The platform is based on components and services architecture, as well as on open and close source hardware and opensource software that reduces its acquisition and operation costs. The platform has been used to develop several remote mobile monitoring m-health systems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

abstract={Cloud computing is not only referred as synonym of on-demand usage of computing resources and services, but as the most promising paradigm to provide infinite scalability by using virtual infrastructures. In the other hand mobile technologies are scaling up to encompass every day a growing number of real and virtual objects in order to provide large-scale data applications, e.g. sensor-based intelligent communications networks, smart grid computing applications, etc. In those complex scenarios, cloud-based computing systems need to cope with diverse service demands in order to enable dynamic composition based on particular user's demands, variations in collected data broadband, fluctuation of data quality and to satisfy ad-hoc usage for personalized applications. Thus essential characteristics from cloud-native systems i.e. elasticity and multi-tenancy are fundamental requirements into large-scale data processing systems. In this paper we have investigated common practices on information sharing and domain ontological modelling to enable service composition of cloud computing service provisioning. This approach exploits the potential of semantic models in supporting service and application linkage by studying links between the complementary services. By using semantic modelling and knowledge engineering we can enable the composition of services. We discuss what implications this approach imposes on architectural design terms and also how virtual infrastructures and cloud-based systems can benefit from this ontological modelling approach. Research results about information sharing and information modelling by using semantic annotations are discussed. An introductory application scenario is depicted. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={In the distributed development of modern IT systems, contracts play a vital role in ensuring interoperability of components and adherence to specifications. The design of embedded systems, however, is made more complex by the heterogeneous nature of components, which are often described using different models and interaction mechanisms. Composing such components is generally not well-defined, making design and verification difficult. Several frameworks, both operational and denotational, have been proposed to handle heterogeneity using a variety of approaches. However, the application of heterogeneous operational models to contract-based design has not yet been investigated. In this work, we adopt the operational mechanism of tag machines to represent heterogeneous systems and construct a full contract model. We introduce heterogeneous composition, refinement and dominance between contracts, altogether enabling a formalized and rigorous design process for heterogeneous systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={Enterprises operate in an increasingly turbulent environment. In order to stay competitive, more and more complex decisions have to be taken. Production systems are not relatively closed systems any more, but often part of supply networks with a high number of resulting interfaces. Planning and operation of factories are tightened together. At the same time virtual reality, as the mean of modern factory planning, merges with the real world. The processes of planning and operation are supported by a variety of software tools. With reference to operation of enterprises a lot of effort is put in integrating the different tools, while there is a deficit concerning the integration of factory planning tools. Therefore, the paper will look at the current state of interoperability in factory planning. The requirements and use cases of data exchange between tools for factory planning as well as other enterprise software, are discussed. Thereby, challenges and opportunities resulting from better hardware performance, faster communication networks and a wide range of new types of devices are listed. The consequences of trends like cloud computing and big data are classified. Conclusions are derived for possible architectures of software systems.

abstract={Efficient mechanisms for data structuring and formatting are indispensable for managing data traffic between and within federated Cloud environments to avoid excessive bandwidth cost and to ensure portability and interoperability. This facilitates provider-agnostic communication, which is essential for interoperable inter-Cloud deployments and portable integration of service components, both with one another and with the underlying Cloud platform. The existing data interchange formats for structuring and serialising data have not yet been analysed in the context of data communication in Clouds. Thus, to address this issue, the determination of an appropriate data interchange format for Clouds is necessary. In this paper, we present a performance analysis of some selected data interchange formats to assess their efficiency in terms of their usability in realising a common messaging format for communicating data in Clouds. We first describe the characteristics of each data format for clear understanding. As a basis for the analysis, we introduce a Cloud use case scenario comprising the transmission of monitored data as messages. The communication means is achieved with a novel message bus system designed to integrate the data interchange formats. We present some evaluations of the formats and compare their compactness for supporting efficient data transmission in Clouds. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud and Web Services technologies offer a powerful cost-effective and fast growing approach to the provision of infrastructure, platform and software as services. However, these technologies still raise significant concerns regarding security assurance and compliance of data and software services offered. A new trend of a service security certification has been recently proposed to overcome the limitations of existing security certificates by representing security certification in a structured, machine-processable manner that will enable automated reasoning for certified security features in security-critical domains. However, the richness and flexibility of the underlying certificate models and languages comes with the price of increased complexity in processing and comparing those certificates and related security claims in practice. In this paper, we propose the concept of certificate profile to provide a mechanism to address processability and interoperability of service security certificates. We present a conceptual model and a concrete realization of the model within the context of the European project ASSERT4SOA. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={Cloud Computing has emerged as a new paradigm for services delivering over the Internet. In this growing market, PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) service model has been the subject of great interest from several organizations allowing a straightforward deployment of applications without the need for a dedicated infrastructure, dependencies installation or server configuration. However, each PaaS provider generates a lock-in to their proprietary features, technologies or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This paper focuses on the specification, development and test of an abstraction layer that aims to unify the management and information processes of applications and databases created in PaaS environments, in order to struggle the existing lock-in in the market. As result, PaaS users will have now the opportunity for selecting the most appropriate platform for an application, interacting seamlessly with any supported vendor, also having the opportunity to attain the portability of applications among distinct PaaS providers.

Taiwan's National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs) had been playing a major role developing related technologieswith the goal to more efficient disaster management. Established in 2003, NARLabs has combined elevenresearch institutes into an independent non-profit institute. One of the four research fields associated with disaster prediction and early warning systems has been in priority list, such as Formosat-2 remote sensingsatellite, Formosat-3/COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate), cloud computing, typhoon and flood research, ocean research, earthquake engineering, and disaster management technologies. NARLabs takes its advantage to synergize capabilities to support government's mission on disaster management as well as to involve the international activities, such as Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Architecture Implementation Pilot projects, and Sentinel Asia, a voluntary disaster response and management organization in Asia Pacific regions.

We illustrate a Cloud service management approach based on matchmaking operations and self-management principles which enable improved distribution and management of IoT services across different Cloud vendors and use the results from the analysis as mechanism to control applications and services deployment in Cloud systems.

In the future, Cloud brokers will offer services based on their knowledge of Cloud providers infrastructure to automatically and cost-effectively overcome performance degradation. In this paper, we present a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) that provides a cost-effective placement across multiple Clouds. Our MILP formulation considers parameters of Cloud providers such as price, configuration of VMs, network latency, and provisioning time. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of deploying a Cloud infrastructure into a single or across multiple Cloud providers by using real prices and VM configurations. The results show that in some cases may be cost-effective to distribute the infrastructure across multiple Cloud providers. We also propose three placement policies for faulty multi-Cloud scenarios. The best of these policies minimizes the cost of the Cloud infrastructure under fixed provisioning time values. © 2013 IEEE.},

This trend is furthermore propounded by the plethora of apps down loadable to end-user devices mostly within mobile-cum-cloud environments. It is clear that there are many evidences of innovation with regard to end-user devices and apps. Unfortunately little, if any, information security innovation took place over the past number of years with regard to the consumption of security services by end-users. This creates the need for innovative security solutions that are humancentric and flexible.

abstract={Recent advances in information technology make remote collaboration and resource sharing easier for next generation distributed systems, such as grids and clouds. One common model of study is the convergence of these systems, along with interclouds to a unified global computing resource. Despite similarities between grids and clouds, there are a number of fundamental differences that make this convergence process harder. For example, clouds have inherent administrative boundaries, something which the grid computing paradigm avoided from the early stages of research. Such administrative boundaries primarily affect capabilities of clouds to be interoperable. Moreover, they also negatively affect the possibility of a seamless intercloud federation on the path to convergence. Resource sharing in general and related communication methodologies, such as information dissemination and matchmaking are also integral elements in this convergence process. To help improve the success of distributed cloud resource schedulers, we propose proxies that disseminate information as agent s of dissemination sources. Such proxies can then make information about resource states available at 'distant' clouds, where there may be no direct, or even no indirect control. Moreover, they can make this resource state available more efficiently than where no proxies are used. In particular, with proxies, dissemination overhead is reduced by up to 65% under different scenarios, where existing solutions may not even produce efficient protocols. In addition, proxies help reduce dissemination overhead by 19% on average. Our results also show that randomly selecting proxy nodes perform comparably to other strategies that may select proxies based on particular criteria. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the present days, business applications are still designed for human consumption, which does not allow machines to understand the information contained in them, particularly preventing the correlation between concepts from different fields, in the generation and submission of new information for the handling of large data sets. The increasing complexity of applications, increases the attention in the construction of knowledgeable systems that can be understood and shared by all (application / machines / people). Using the concept of Ontology as a tool for knowledge representation has been effective, in order to develop applications with these said characteristics, since the semantic models have the ability to map and integrate different concepts from the same domain or different domains of knowledge, related to each other, therefore providing conditions for understanding the information contained herewith. Presently, there are different proposals for the aforesaid mapping, considering the semantics and ontological integrations, as well as interoperability of the information systems. This study presents a conceptual modeling in domain knowledge, about the potential vulnerabilities in environments, IaaS, in the public cloud, as a scenario using ontology reasoning. The purpose this modeling, is to provide an effective mechanism, capable of handling two major security issues, such as: providing a common vocabulary to describe vulnerabilities unambiguously and resolving the issue of semantic interoperability between the databases of vulnerabilities maintained by various entities. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={System management becomes increasingly complex and brings high costs, especially with the advent of Cloud Computing. For controlling the management cost, in particular the manual management cost, many computer programs have been developed to take over manual management tasks or reduce their complexity and difficulty. These programs are usually hard-coded by languages like Java and C++, which bring enough capability and flexibility but also cause high programming effort and cost. This paper proposes an architecture based approach to developing the management programs in a simple but powerful enough manner. First of all, the manageability of a given platform is abstracted as a runtime model of the platform's software architecture, which can automatically and immediately propagate any observable runtime changes of the target platforms to the corresponding architecture models, and vice versa. Then the management programs will be developed using modeling languages, instead of those relatively "low-level" programming languages. Such architecture-level management programs bring many advantages related to the performance, interoperability, reusability and simplicity. © 2012 Authors.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a buzz word that is also spilling over into the education industry, which enables access to software applications, hardware, data, and computer processing power on the Web, rather than installing software onto one's computer or server. For education, it offers new possibilities to structure and perform learning processes. In this study, the potential impact of cloud computing on education is analyzed, showing what it means for educators and students as well as institutions, and summarized under the heading 'Generation C', where C stands for cloud. The results of the study revealed that cloud computing can be used by educators, institutions, and individual students as well as by jurisdiction to support particular teaching and learning experiences and to organize software availability. Challenges for educators and institutions using cloud computing in teaching could be summarized under the following keywords: interoperability and transferability, terms and conditions, security and privacy issues, backup and perpetuity, denial of service and content issues. On a whole, some implications of using cloud computing need to be kept in mind, good understanding of the applications in use, development of guidelines for use and migration strategies as well as the implementation of risk management could allow educators and institutions to take advantage of cloud computing, in turn offering rich online learning experiences for students.},

abstract={Many organizations from the public and the private sector are planning to turn to Cloud Computing services, whose main benefits are flexibility, pay-per-use model and significant cost reduction. However, this new business paradigm for the provision of computing infrastructure has certain obstacles, including provider lock-in. When a client chooses a specific Cloud service provider, he also gets the provider's specific protocols, standards and tools, making a potential future migration complex and costly. Cloud Computing is still immature, with no firmly established standards governing all the aspects of its utilization. The migration issue can be overcome by using interoperable Cloud services. In this paper we focus on the platform as a service (PaaS) model of Cloud Computing. This model provides a complete computing platform needed to run applications over the Internet. Every PaaS provider (such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce) has specified its custom application programming interfaces (APIs). However, to achieve interoperability we need to develop a standardized set of APIs that constitute an interoperability platform. In this paper, we firstly present the key concepts and relevant related work from the existing literature. Thereafter we propose a novel PaaS API ontology to share a common understanding of the main concepts from providers' APIs. We used a prominent ontology development methodology to determine the domain and scope of our ontology, review similar existing ontologies, define the relevant classes and their hierarchy as well as to define the properties of classes and create their instances. The concepts in our ontology were derived from PaaS resources, remote Cloud functions specified in the API documentation of the most important PaaS solutions, existing Cloud ontologies, Cloud Computing models andstandards for Semantic Web services. The aim of the proposed ontology is the description of PaaS resourcesand their operations. It was built using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Protege tool. In the future, we plan to use this ontology to semantically annotate PaaS API operations and create a mechanism to determineand solve interoperability problems among two or more PaaS services provided by different vendors.},

abstract={The dependency of today's construction professionals to use singular commercial applications for design possibilities creates the risk of being dictated by the language-tools they use. This unknowingly approach to converting to the constraints of a particular computer application's style, reduces one's association with cutting-edge design as no single computer application can support all of the tasks associated with building-design and production. Interoperability depicts the need to pass data between applications, allowing multiple types of experts and applications to contribute to the work at hand. Cloud computing is a centralized heterogeneous platform that enables different applications to be connected to each other through using remote data servers. However, the possibility of providing an interoperable process based on binding several construction applications through a single repository platform 'cloud computing' required further analysis. The following Delphi questionnaires analysed the exchanging information opportunities of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as the possible solution for the integration of applications on a cloud platform. The survey structure is modelled to; (i) identify the most appropriate applications for advancing interoperability at the early design stage, (ii) detect the most severe barriers of BIM implementation from a business and legal viewpoint, (iii) examine the need for standards to address information exchange between design team, and (iv) explore the use of the most common interfaces for exchanging information. The anticipated findings will assist in identifying a model that will enhance the standardized passing of information between systems at the feasibility design stage of a construction project.},

Virtualization has enabled cloud computing to be more of a utility-based computing where applications, platforms, storage and etc are provided as a service to the users over the Internet. The first half of the paper will provide an overview of virtual machines, virtual machine monitors (hypervisors) and the different virtualization architectures. After introducing virtual memory management from the standpoint of traditional computer architecture, we will describe in detail the virtualization of virtual memory address spaces and their implementation through shadow page table and nested page tables.

There is a wide acceptance of the requirement for smarter grids to support such changes and accommodate variable injections from renewable energy sources. However the design templates are still emerging to manage the level of information required to meet challenges such as balancing, planning and market dynamics under this new paradigm. While secure and scalable cloud computing architectures may contribute to supporting the informatics challenges of the smart grid, this paper focuses on the essential need for business alignment with standardised information models such as the IEC Common Information Model (CIM), to leverage data value and control system interoperability.

abstract={Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are generally known as open and free systems since resources are often contributed from voluntary participants. Their limitation, however, is that they only support simple resource sharing such as file (storage) sharing and bandwidth sharing. On the other hand, based on virtualization techniques, cloud computing provides a more flexible mechanism to share all types of resources with no limitations. Nevertheless, the use of cloud computing usually requires a fee and is often locked-in to services of cloud computing providers (i.e., vendor lock-in). In this paper, we aim to combine P2P and cloud computing technologies to design and develop PC 2, an open and free cloud computing platform that allows users to participate in any time to contribute as well as to consume sharing resources. While this combination inherits good advantages of these two technologies, it also avoid their disadvantages. As a proof-of-concept, we have developed a prototype for PC2 based on Eucalyptus, the most popular open source for building cloud computing platforms. © 2012 IEEE.},

To fill the gap, this study draws upon multiple theories to examine factors that influence individuals' intention to use cloud applications. It shows that a person's attitude toward cloud applications, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control have direct impacts on the person's behavioral intention to use the applications. Meanwhile, personal beliefs about the risks and benefits of cloud applications, including privacy and security concerns, concerns about vendor lock-in, perceived vendor reputation, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived transferability of previously learned computer skills, have indirect impacts on behavioral intention. The study is the first to examine individual acceptance of cloud computing from a multi-theoretical perspective.

Especially infrastructure services, like storage and scalable computing resources, are gaining relevance and provide alternatives to conventional sourcing models. Despite the Cloud paradigm of flexible and limitless scalability the lack of standardization presents a big challenge in this context. Due to many providers, which are using different Cloud software including proprietary interfaces, the interoperability in the Cloud remains a theoretical construct. In this paper we examine standardization approaches within Cloud Computing and provide a comparison to practical implementations of interfaces of relevant Cloud software on the market. Finally, characteristics for a potential Cloud standard on the infrastructure level will be postulated. © 2012 Polish Info Processing Socit.},

It implements the API Amazon Web Service (AWS), allowing interoperability with other AWS-based services. Elastic block storage is a technology which provides flexible allocation of remote storage volumes to the virtual machines running in a cloud computing environment. This work investigates the software aging effects on the Eucalyptus framework, considering workloads composed of intensive requests for attaching remote storage volumes to virtual machines. The results evidenced problems that may be harmful to system dependability and its performance due to RAM memory exhaustion and subsequent use of swap memory, besides high CPU utilization by the virtual machines and subsequent increase in the response time of applications running on the VMs. © 2012 IEEE.},

Eucalyptus is a software framework used to implement private and hybrid-style Infrastructure as a Service clouds. It implements the Amazon Web Service (AWS) API, allowing interoperability with other AWS-based services. Elastic block storage (EBS) is a technology which provides flexible allocation of remote storage volumes to the virtual machines running in a cloud computing environment. Eucalyptus interacts with many software components to provide EBS features to the virtual machines: KVM hypervisor and Eucalyptus Node Controller (NC) are among those components. This work investigates the software aging effects in a Eucalyptus environment, considering workloads composed of intensive requests for attaching remote storage volumes to virtual machines. The results evidenced that memory leaks in Node Controller and the high CPU utilization by the KVM process are strongly correlated. The experimental analysis also show how much the aging effects are related to the performance degradation of a virtualized web server running on this infrastructure. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Concerns about the security and reliability of data storage in online systems, alias cloud storage services, have led to the design of application-independent storage overlays and controllers which guarantee security and optimality with regards to the requirements of their users. In roaming and multi-user environments, the configuration and rules steering these controllers should be easily extensible and migratable in order to not simply shift the vendor lock-in from the service provider to the controller software or appliance. Despite this requirement, there is no language available yet to express such rules and policies. Therefore, we introduce the Flexible Data Distribution Policy Language (FlexDDPL) to formulate storage policies, evaluate it against language design guidelines, and demonstrate its practical usability within a dispersing cloud storage gateway architecture. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The space mission design and operations community already recognizes the value of cloud computing and virtualization. However, natural and valid concerns, like security, privacy, up-time, and vendor lock-in, have prevented a more widespread and expedited adoption into official workflows. In the interest of alleviating these concerns, we propose a series of guidelines for internally deploying a resource-oriented hub of data and algorithms. These guidelines provide a roadmap for implementing an architecture inspired in the cloud com- puting model: associative, elastic, semantical, interconnected, and adaptive. The architec- ture can be summarized as exposing data and algorithms as resource-oriented Web services, coordinated via messaging, and running on virtual machines; it is simple, and based on widely adopted standards, protocols, and tools. The architecture may help reduce com- mon sources of complexity intrinsic to data-driven, collaborative interactions and, most importantly, it may provide the means for teams and agencies to evaluate the cloud com- puting model in their specific context, with minimal infrastructure changes, and before committing to a specific cloud services provider. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

With improvements in internetworking technologies and increase in network bandwidth speeds, a new era of computing has been ushered in, that of grids and clouds. With several commercial cloud providers coming up, each with their own APIs, application description formats, and varying support for SLAs, vendor lockin has become a serious issue for end users. This article attempts to describe the problem, issues, possible solutions and challenges in achieving cloud interoperability. These issues will be analyzed in the ambit of the European project Contrail that is trying to adopt open standards with available virtualization solutions to enhance users' trust in the clouds by attempting to prevent vendor lock-ins, supporting and enforcing SLAs together with adequate data protection for sensitive data. © 2012 IFIP.},

abstract={Contemporary cloud technologies face insurmountable obstacles. They follow a pull-based, producer-centric trajectory to development where cloud consumers have to 'squeeze and bolt' applications onto cloud APIs. They also introduce a monolithic SaaS/PaaS/IaaS stack where a one-size-fits-all mentality and vendor lock-in prevail. As a consequence consumers cannot mix and match functionality from diverse tiers of the cloud stack - horizontally or vertically - dynamically configuring it to address their needs. This paper presents an approach that overcomes these obstacles by providing an innovative reference architecture, an enhanced cloud delivery model which breaks down the rigidity of the cloud stack and transforms it into modular and easily combined components, and a complete integration and management environment that offers integration-as-a-service functionality. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This paper is a survey of the most influential published CCI models and discusses their pos- sibilities and challenges. The accent in this paper is set to analysis of the Software as a Service (SaaS) CCI model based on adapters. The current state of the cloud computing market and the results of recent Cloud Computing (CC) market surveys are also included in our analysis. The presented conclusion addresses the increasing trend in the usage of cloud computing and the lack of visible result to achieve cloud computing interoperability. So the next logical step is to create adapters to achieve interoperability at the SaaS level. Copyright © 2012 by the paper's authors.},

The paper refers to existing standards in Cloud Computing, in particular, recently published NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (CCRA). The proposed ICAF defines four complementary components addressing Intercloud integration and interoperability: multilayer Cloud Services Model that combines commonly adopted cloud service models, such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, in one multilayer model with corresponding inter-layer interfaces; Intercloud Control and Management Plane that supports cloud based applications interaction; Intercloud Federation Framework, and Intercloud Operation Framework. The paper briefly describes the architectural framework for cloud based infrastructure services provisioned on-demand being developed in the framework of the GEYSERS project that is used as a basis for building multilayer cloud services integration framework that allows optimized provisioning of both computing, storage and networking resources. The proposed architecture is intended to provide an architectural model for developing Intercloud middleware and in this way will facilitate clouds interoperability and integration. © 2012 IEEE.},

Not only the migration between clouds is difficult - but also the development and deployment of a new, complex service from the beginning could be quite a challenge using today's cloud computing. In the paper, new high-level abstraction layers for cloud computing is presented.

abstract={Cloud computing has seen a tremendous growth in the last five years. Along with the growth, many cloud types have been marketed. However, from the view of users, there are still barriers to exploit the cloud computing. Not only the migration into clouds is difficult, even so the development and deployment of new services from the beginning could be quite challenges. In this paper, we present a novel development framework for cloud services. Its design is based on abstraction approach and object-oriented programming technique, allowing cloud users to easily and rapidly develop and deploy their services. The approach also enables service migration and interoperability among the different clouds. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={Cloud computing is the next generation of computing paradigm. Along with cloud computing, many related problems come up. And these problems in turn slow the speed of the development of cloud computing down. Among these problems, e.g. interoperability and privacy, identity management and security are strong concerned. Many researchers and enterprises have already done a lot to optimize the identity management and strengthen the security in cloud computing. Most of these studies focus on the usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it's adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping algorithm as the deploy strategy. Security is another problem involved in this paper. Since many researchers have done many detailed and fruitful studies in security, the security solution illustrated in this paper is specific in the proposed architecture. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Though the current cloud computing is in its initial stage of development, some established players, such as Amazon, Google, Salesforce.com, have captured market shares with their own strategies and standards. However, for a further development for this immature market, it has been proposed a general standard (like TCP/IP for internet) among cloud participants. There are some standards under drafting, but it seems impractical for established players to agree on a general one, for they already have their own standards. What's more, the ongoing creation in the industry undermines standardization; On the other hand, each cloud provider is taking an active role in making its own API, for instance VMware's vCloud, an open standard, but the cost is consumers' lock-in. Thus, conversion technology seems to have a brighter future than standardization towards achieving interoperability. This study discusses various issues concerning the realization of interoperability by conversion technology. Primarily, an economic model is used for reference to analyze the market's incentive to adopt such technology, especially in such a market with network effects. Then a sequence of issues regarding technique, economy, management, security and politics are put forward and discussed, ending with an outlook for the industry. These discussions have important implications for realization of interoperability under the current condition where standardization is somewhat costly and impractical. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In a cloud ecosystem, most of the data and software that users use reside on the remote server(s), which brings some new challenges for the system, especially security and privacy. At present, these security threats and attacks are the greatest concern for the service providers towards delivering a more secure cloud infrastructure. One of the major concerns is data security, implemented by the most effective means possible and the protection of stored data from unauthorized users and hackers. When considering these security issues, trust is one of the most important means to improve the system's security and enable interoperability of current heterogeneous cloud computing platforms. The objective of this chapter is to discuss and understand the basic security and privacy challenges of a cloud computing environment as the security of cloud computing is the greatest challenge for delivering a safer cloud environment for both the service providers and the service customers. With this in mind, this chapter will introduce the risks and possible attacks in a cloud computing environment. The major goal is to specify the security risks and attacks and consider trust of cloud service users for delivering a safer and innovation business model. © 2013, IGI Global.},

abstract={Most cloud computing service providers secure their offered cloud services by username/password schemes, which have been proven to be weak. While such schemes may be sufficient for simple personalized services, e-Government or e-Health applications in the cloud require more reliable and stronger mechanisms. One of such mechanisms are electronic IDs (eID), which allow for unique qualified identification and strong authentication. EIDs have been rolled-out in many EU Member States since years. In this paper we present how various national eIDs can be used for secure cloud authentication. We therefore extended the STORK eID interoperability framework, which will be the relevant identification and authentication framework across Europe in future. Furthermore, we increased usability by additionally applying single sign-on (SSO). Single sign-on defines the ability to authenticate just once in a distributed environment and gain access to several protected services. In fact, by our extended STORK architecture citizens of 18 EU Member States - those Member States that support STORK - are able to use seamless authentication at different cloud service providers by using their own national eID. © 2012 Infonomics Society.},

abstract={Cloud computing is one of the most promising solutions for present and future water related problems. Planning and management of both urban water systems and basinscale water resources systems are increasingly becoming multidisciplinary collaborative tasks that will rely on development of internet based systems based on web services that combine water related data, weather forecasts, climate variations, urbanization, population and economic growth, etc. These heterogeneous data sources (frequently provided by different institutions) may be integrated 'on demand' for water management tasks via cloud computing applications as the one demonstrated here. Cloud computing advantages over previous technologies are in the scalable computation power, internet based collaboration platform, transparency in the decision making processes and dissemination of valuable information between stakeholders and general public. The architecture of prototype cloud application for water resources modeling is based on the latest advancement in computer science and technology: Cloud Computing, Service Oriented Architecture and web Geographic Information Systems. The prototype cloud application integrate three web services: (1) web service for managing of geospatial data (2) web service for support of water resources modeling. The components and software packages used in the development of the system are open source. The overall architecture and system components are flexible for adding new or upgrading existing web services. The system is scalable, interoperable and can work in distributed computer environment. © SGEM2012 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM Published by STEF92 Technology Ltd.},

A cloud contains infrastructure (Servers, Storage, Networks), applications (web apps, database, backup etc.) from various vendors. Generally, different vendor products are managed (discovery, provisioning, monitoring etc.) by their own proprietary management software. Today, in clouds there is no standard way to manage infrastructure and applications using a single management framework. This will cause cloud management a complex task and creates interoperability issues. The Cloud infrastructure cannot be easily replaced due to dependency on the management software.

abstract={With the emergence of service-oriented economy, distributed systems and cloud computing, thus the development of service oriented architecture and the adoption open standards become a mean to assure interoperability. Privacy could play a key role for digital identity protection and security. We suggest an implementation framework, Privacy-as-a-Set-of-Services (PaaSS) framework, which could help information system's security team to implement digital identity privacy requirements into a set of services. The framework relays on the idea that digital identity privacy business interoperability should be taken into consideration from the outset of the project in order to be able to provide technical interoperability. Business interoperability is a set of requirements that are drawn from global, domestic and business-specific privacy policies, however, technical interoperability is offered through the adoption of open standards and implementation of a set of services and service's interfaces that could accommodate SOA. The framework is in accordance of model-driven architecture (MDA) approach and it is composed of five layers and three mapping gateways. Inter- & intra-layers iterations are consequence of SOA delivery lifecycle and strategies alignment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

The cloud market is still in its infancy and all major issues, ranging from interoperability and standardization, to legislation and SLA contracts are still wide open. However, the main obstacle for a more catholic acceptance of the cloud model is security. In the CC model, the client has limited control over his data and computations as he outsources everything to the cloud provider. This basic CC feature influences several security related areas. In this paper, we investigate the impact that the CC model has on the digital forensics methodologies. Digital Forensics (DF) is the branch of computer science that develops evidence pertained in the digital world for use in civil or criminal court proceedings and this shared ownership of digital resources that the CC model inherits influences severely their analysis. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing goal is to support the IT organizations to integrate their services globally. It can help enterprises to improve their creation and delivery of IT solutions by providing them to access services in a cost effective and flexible manner. Cloud applications have different compositions, configurations, and deployment requirements. Quantifying the performance of scheduling and allocation policies in a real Cloud environment is extremely challenging due to several reasons like, variety of demands, supply patterns, and system size, heterogeneous and meeting the requirements of users competitively. To simplify this process, we develop a Dynamic Enterprise Architecture- (DEA) through industry collaboration to enable interoperability among various clouds and service providers. The Dynamic Architecture helps the user to utilize the services and integrate their applications from anywhere in the world by on demand, at competitive costs. Resources can be dynamically adjusted pertaining to the demand. It selects the suitable service provider or the coordination of the service provider according to the requirement of the user. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2012.},

abstract={The Ensemble project has consistently identified common patterns pertaining to activity planning across missions, analogs, and field tests. In this process, we have developed a unified planning repository that serves Mars Science Laboratory, International Space Station, Analog Field tests like Pavilion Lake Research Project, and many others. This repository encapsulates complexities associated with persistence, indexing, access and synchronization of data required for distributed planning. By providing a uniform Restful interface to the clients, the plan repository enables access from a variety of clients spanning multiple NASA centers. These clients range from shell scripts and browsers to mobile apps and complex desktop applications. It supports multiple representations, or formats, of plans to support multiple clients. With a focus on interoperability, end-users from disparate clients are able to interact with each other seamlessly. With support for rich querying capabilities through an inverted index of all of the activities and plans stored in the repository, we allow operators and scientists to search for the plans based on tactically relevant criteria with structured and unstructured (full-text) queries. Lastly, in order to support distributed planning, the repository incorporates a messaging layer to synchronize plans across multiple geographically dispersed clients in real-time. In this paper, we describe common patterns in tactical planning and the feature sets we have built to support them. Furthermore, we share key insights and lessons learned from deploying plan repository on a variety of missions and field tests. We provide an overview of the novel integration of technologies that support planning repository, and we discuss the role of cloud computing in our deployment strategy. We conclude with an overview of future research and upcoming features in the plan repository. © 2012 by Jet Propulsion Laboratory / California Institute of Technology.},

abstract={In modern healthcare environments, healthcare providers are more willing to shift their electronic medical record systems to clouds. Instead of building and maintaining dedicated data centers, this paradigm enables to achieve lower operational cost and better interoperability with other healthcare providers. However, the adoption of cloud computing in healthcare systems may also raise many security challenges associated with authentication, identity management, access control, trust management, and so on. In this paper, we focus on access control issues in electronic medical record systems in clouds. We propose a systematic access control mechanism to support selective sharing of composite electronic health records (EHRs) aggregated from various healthcare providers in clouds. Our approach ensures that privacy concerns are accommodated for processing access requests to patients' healthcare information.We also demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our approach by implementing a proof-of-concept prototype along with evaluation results. © 2012 ICST.},

abstract={The importance of healthcare information technology has increased dramatically during the past few years. Researchers, developers, and companies have placed efforts to develop mobile, web, desktop, and enterprise e-health applications. This development raised the importance of interoperability and data exchange between e-health applications and Health Information Systems (HIS), which resulted in increased concerns for securing sensitive data and data exchange. This paper emphasizes standardizing a data exchange mechanism and interoperability between HISs and e-health applications across a cloud-based service. The proposed service provides a single point of entry for retrieving Electronic Medical Records (EMR) among the various HISs that a patient record is stored in and for any e-health application seeking such information. Moreover, this research proposes a unified secure platform that provides developers, health care providers, and organizations access to a framework to retrieve and manage medical records and Personal Health Records (PHR) among various subscribers. The proposed service and platform have been qualitatively evaluated among a sample of physicians, patients, and hospital administrators from the Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Egypt.

To support patient-controlled encryption and privacy-preserving keyword search, we use ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption and public-key encryption with keyword search schemes, again in an integrated, embedded, and fine-grained manner. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The advent of cloud computing has offered scientific communities the ability to access computational resources that can satisfy their growing research needs starting to outgrow the size of traditional local resources as PCs and locally managed clusters and also of grid sites. Since grids and clouds are heterogeneous in nature and are based on different middlewares, interoperability between the service interfaces exposing the capabilities of these infrastructures is recognized as an important issue. This problem is usually handled by using the appropriate adaptors to interact with several middlewares thus allowing the applications to be executed on federated infrastructures. While aiming for federated resources access, there is an overhead for the application clients to continuously detect and adapt to every evolution of the target middlewares. In the presented work a complementary approach is followed to circumvent this problem by enabling interoperability between different execution services through the adoption of open and widely adopted standards.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach for the classification of the religious scriptures, the Hadith (sayings of Prophet Muhammad (plural Ahadith)). Muhadith is a distributed, Cloud based expert system that uses the Hadith science to classify Ahadith among 24 types from seven broad categories. Classification of the Hadith is a complex and sensitive task, and can only be performed by an expert of the Hadith sciences. Muhadith expert system is designed to imitate the Hadith experts for Hadith classification, and to enable a computer to behave like a Hadith expert to discriminate the authentic Ahadith from unauthentic ones. This paper presents the relationship and mapping of the expert system technology onto Hadith sciences, and technicalities involved in designing of the Muhadith expert system. We also propose solutions for the communicational and interoperability problems faced by the legacy web based distributed expert systems. We employ service oriented architecture to overcome the communicational problem and a candidature for the Software as a Service (SaaS) for the Cloud computing.

abstract={Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a novel paradigm that enables software developers to create (develop or integrate), deploy, execute, and manage business applications, using a service provided by a third party. The diversity and heterogeneity of the existing PaaS offerings raises several interoperability challenges. The actual Platform as a Service market is still quite young, chaotic and highly fragmented, dominated by a few providers which use and promote incompatible standards and formats. This introduces adoption barriers due to the lock-in issues that prevent the portability of data and software from one PaaS to another. Moreover, software developers do not only need to deploy applications into a specific Cloud platform, but also to migrate applications from one Cloud platform to another, and to manage distributed applications spanning multiple PaaS. In this paper, we present a multi-cloud PaaS management as a result of the Cloud4SOA European project that addresses these challenges. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={When interoperability among cloud systems will be fully achieved, a new scenario of business opportunities will open up. The competition among cloud providers will be played on the ground of the QoS to be delivered to customers. Future cloud markets will have to be provided with new tools to help players express their business requirements, and to make the match between what is demanded and what is offered. In this work we propose a semantic model to support the characterization of providers' offers and of customers' requests from a business point of view. Furthermore, a semantic engine was developed to carry on the supply-demand matchmaking. Tests were run on a software prototype to prove the proposed solution's viability. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a pilot project effort under the auspices of the Namibian Ministry of Agriculture Water and Forestry (MAWF)/Department of Water Affairs, the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS) /Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS) and originally moderated by the United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER). The effort began by identifying and prototyping technologies which enabled the rapid gathering and dissemination of both space-based and ground sensor data and data products for the purpose of flood disaster management. This was followed by an international collaboration to build small portions of the identified system which was prototyped during the past few years during the flood seasons which occurred in the February through May timeframe of 2010 and 2011 with further prototyping to ongoing in 2012. The pilot effort has been fostered by CEOS to facilitate international efforts to promote satellite sensor data interoperability. In particular, the group has been making use of a technology effort call SensorWeb being developed at NASA which leverages Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards to facilitate various satellite and ground sensor interoperability. The group has made use of such satellites such as Earth Observing 1, Terra/Aqua MODIS and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Radarsat together with various ground sensors such as river gauges in Namibia and models such as Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) from Joint Research Center (JRC) from the European Commission. Finally, the group has been experimenting with integrating a large Cloud Computing service provided by the Open Cloud Consortium (OCC) with the SensorWeb to provide management and distribution of the large data sets for emergency workers. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the past few years, an increasing number of organizations have been considering the use of some form of cloud computing for their business purpose. However, the market of cloud resources is still in its infancy due to, among other reasons, the lack of interoperability among existing cloud platforms. In this paper we argue that a successful open cloud market needs a flexible and powerful way to express actors' requirements. In order to address this issue, we developed a set of ontologies to capture and express the business aspects of providers' offerings and customers' requests. To the best of our knowledge this is one of the first attempt to build a cloud ontology focused on business related concepts rather than on technical aspects. The ontology discussed here is just the first step of our work: the final aim is to define an exhaustive set of business-oriented requirements to support the implementation of a semantic cloud resource publish/discovery mechanism. © 2012 IEEE.},

Due to the multi-tenant nature of Cloud environment, its size and use of massive virtualization, the current monitoring solutions are approaching their limits. Unlike some other approaches, focusing on data integration, aggregation, and abstraction, our work focuses on a virtual machine representing the primary source of monitoring information. In this paper, we propose requirements for the producer of monitoring information addressing existing issues related to monitoring data representation, storage, processing and distribution. As a proof-of-concept, conforming to these requirements, prototype of event-based monitoring daemon is presented in detail. The resulting solution allows multiple users to consume monitoring information in an extensible data format without impairing interoperability. © 2012 IEEE.},

Concurrently, the Foundation will seek to promote measures for a sustainable orbital environment aimed to protect the integrity of space-based safety critical services, such as global navigation systems. The ISSF will operate in close cooperation with the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS), which will provide through its highly knowledgeable membership all the necessary technical support and advice. The ISSF Advisory Council has been set up starting beginning of 2012 and focusing in its first year on developing the ISSF research program, which is intended to sponsor general studies in support of global risk management, conceptual studies on innovative systems, development of dedicated equipment, as well as performance of detailed studies on specific topics. Particular attention has been devoted to space systems interoperability. ISSF has also the aim of being active in space safety promotion, embodying communication and dissemination of safety information to strengthen the safety culture, promoting at the same time the development of safe commercial space flights. Special attention has been posed on the development of a certificate/master program in space safety through a "virtual" International Institute for Space Safety (IISS). The ISSF advisory council will be also called to support to build up the consensus of the so-called "ICAO for Space", which is potentially becoming a sort of "Copernican revolution" in space safety, addressing in the proper way the future of human spaceflight in LEO. Stay international is therefore a must for ISSF.},

abstract={Web 3.0, termed as the semantic web or the web of data is the transformed version of Web 2.0 with technologies and functionalities such as intelligent collaborative filtering, cloud computing, big data, linked data, openness, interoperability and smart mobility. If Web 2.0 is about social networking and mass collaboration between the creator and user, then the Web 3.0 is referring to intelligent applications using natural language processing, machine-based learning and reasoning. From the perspective of advancements in e-Learning, the Web 2.0 technologies have transformed the classroom and converted a passive learner into an active participant in the learning process. This paper posits that the way both previous generations of e-Learning (1.0 and 2.0) have emerged with the prevalent technologies in their kin Web versions (1.0 and 2.0, respectively), it can be argued that e-Learning 3.0 will provide all earlier generations' capabilities enhanced with the Web 3.0 technologies. Furthermore, in this paper, reviewing all the theories of learning and examining closely the theory of connectivism (considered to be the theory of learning for the digital age), it is argued that since most of the technologies that are to be a part of e-Learning 3.0 are addressed by these principles, a call for a new learning theory for e-Learning 3.0 is not justified. Finally, a review of the secondary literature shows that there will be various challenges and issues related to prevalence and adoption of e-Learning 3.0 technologies, for example increased privacy and security risks, web accessibility, readiness of the users, requirement for further standardization of e-Learning technologies and social issues in term of increase of the digital divide.},

abstract={The vision of augmenting computing capabilities of mobile devices, especially smartphones with least cost is likely transforming to reality leveraging cloud computing. Cloud exploitation by mobile devices breeds a new research domain called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). However, issues like portability and interoperability should be addressed for mobile augmentation which is a non-trivial task using component-based approaches. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a promising design philosophy embraced by mobile computing and cloud computing communities to stimulate portable, complex application using prefabricated building blocks called Services. Utilizing distant cloud resources to host and run Services is hampered by long WAN latency. Exploiting mobile devices in vicinity alleviates long WAN latency, while creates new set of issues like Service publishing and discovery as well as clientserver security, reliability, and Service availability. In this paper, we propose a market-oriented architecture based on SOA to stimulate publishing, discovering, and hosting Services on nearby mobiles, which reduces long WAN latency and creates a business opportunity that encourages mobile owners to embrace Service hosting. Group of mobile phones simulate a nearby cloud computing platform. We create new role of Service host by enabling unskilled mobile owners/users to host Services developed by skilled developers. Evidently, Service availability, reliability, and Service-oriented mobile application portability will increase towards green ubiquitous computing in our mobile cloud infrastructure. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Cloud computing becomes mobile when a mobile device tries to access the shared pool of computing resources provided by the cloud, on demand. Mobile applications may enrich their functionality by delegating heavy tasks to the clouds as the remote processing and storage have become possible by adding asynchronous behavior in the communication. However, developing mobile cloud applications involves working with services and APIs from different cloud vendors, which mostly are not interoperable across clouds. Moreover, by adding asynchronicity, mobile applications must rely on push mechanisms which are considered to be moderately reliable, and thus not recommended in scenarios that require high scalability and quality of service (QoS). To counter these problems, and the purpose of this paper, is to design a middleware framework, Mobile Cloud Middleware (MCM), which handles the interoperability issues and eases the use of process-intensive services from smartphones by extending the concept of mobile host. Design/methodology/approach: MCM is developed as an intermediary between the mobile and the cloud, which hides the complexity of dealing with multiple cloud services from mobiles. Several applications are presented to show the benefits of mobiles going cloud-aware. Moreover, to verify the scalability of MCM, load tests are performed on the hybrid cloud resources using well known load balancing mechanisms like HAProxy and Tsung. Findings: From the study it was found that it is possible to handle hybrid cloud services from mobiles by using MCM. The analysis demonstrated that the MCM shows reasonable performance levels of interaction with the user, thus validating the proof of concept. Moreover, MCM decreases the effort in developing mobile cloud applications and helps in keeping soft-real time responses by using its asynchronous approach. Originality/value: MCM fosters the utilization of different types of cloud services rather than the traditional mobile cloud services based on data synchronization. By offloading heavy tasks to the clouds, the framework extends the processing power and storage space capabilities of the constrained smart phones. The applications mentioned in the paper bring an added value by being success stories for mobile cloud computing domain in general. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={E-learning systems provide processes of delivering the learning contents to learners who have different backgrounds, interests, and locations away from a classroom in order to maximize the effectiveness of learning. Usually, the classical e-learning system is based on client/server architecture thus they lack of the scalability, flexibility and interoperability. It makes the learning resources cannot share, and the system improvement is not easily. This paper proposes the cloud computing architecture in the e-learning system that the architecture separate into three layers includes infrastructure, platform and application. This architecture needs to design components in order to transfer the learning resources to the cloud platform. Infrastructure layer, the learning resources from the traditional system are transferred to the cloud database instead of the usual DBMS. Platform layer, a new e-learning system that consists of the CMS, AMS, and other service components were developed. These components were developed to be the intermediary between cloud database and the applications. Finally, application layer, CAT web application and WBI application were developed for interacting with the student's client. The results shown that all applications co-operated with the other components suitably. Applying the cloud computing makes the classical e-learning more scalability, flexibility, and interoperability. Moreover, cloud computing induces the way that e-learning can be share and distribute the learning resources to any kind of devices and platforms. Since the e-learning services are used for a relative short time, pay per use of the cloud could reduce the cost thus the organization pay only for capacity that actually used. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Infrastructure clouds created ideal conditions for users to outsource their infrastructure needs by offering on-demand, shortterm access, pay-as-you-go business model, the use of virtualization technologies which provide a safe and cost-effective way for users to manage and customize their environments, and sheer convenience, as users and institutions no longer have to have specialized IT departments and can focus on their core mission instead. These key innovations however also bring challenges which include high levels of failure; lack of interoperability between cloud providers, which puts significant lock-in pressure on the user, and lack of tools that allow users to leverage the on-demand growing and shrinking of infrastructure. All these factors prevent users from capitalizing on the infrastructure cloud opportunity. In this paper we propose a multicloud auto-scaling service that enables the user to leverage "computational power on tap" provided by infrastructure clouds, i.e., allows the user to easily deploy resources across multiple private, community, and commercial clouds; provides high availability in that it allows users to replace failed resources; and scales to demand. The policies governing scaling are customizable based on system and application-specific indicators. We will describe the service architecture and implementation and discuss results obtained in the sustained deployment and management of thousands of virtual machines on EC2. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Cloud computing has emerged as a new paradigm where IT resources are offered by cloud providers in a flexible and elastic way. However, the use and development of cloud services has not been standardized, thereby deriving in migratability and interoperability difficulties. Different standardization initiatives exist seeking to normalize this situation, however none has predominated and a generalized consensus has not been reached. Consequently, several alternatives have been proposed based on the use of intermediate layers or middlewares seeking to isolate developers from the variability of specific cloud vendor services. These approaches provide a valid solution at the risk of shifting the lock-in effect from vendors to middlewares. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution based on the use of software adaptation (SA) techniques. Different guidelines are presented as the basis of an approach that will favor cloud application interoperability and migratability thereby avoiding vendor lock-in.},

The g-Eclipse framework is such a platform for Grid/Cloud computing based on the Eclipse eco system. Based on the g-Eclipse/Eclipse architecture new scientific applications/tools can be integrated in this workbench. The g-Eclipse workbench is an ideal starting point for building such a workbench for astro particle physics. The usage of remote Cloud resources requires the development of an interoperable communication and software provisioning system too. Using OSGi as a interoperable, provider-independent platform for Cloud computing, the management of the Cloud resources will be simplified significantly.

abstract={One of the promising directions for multi-architecture distributed simulation interoperability has been the use of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for component management, installation, configuration, initialization, and control. Many of the challenges of distributed simulation are addressed by SOA's principles of interface standardization, loose-coupling of services, and service composability. The impetus for employing SOA in this manner is simulation asset reuse, increased accessibility, and the potential of rapid component deployment. Despite the upbeat technical and financial outlook for employing SOA in this domain, there are barriers that have been recognized. This paper presents a distributed simulation-specific architectural paradigm for employing SOA, descriptions of successful implementations, and a hard look at both the current technical, financial, and managerial challenges to bridging the gap between the traditional approach: operating distributed simulations in static, isolated configurations, and the use of a SOA approach: using highly dynamic, reusable/reconfigurable simulations with multiple contributors.},

abstract={Cloud computing is one the most relevant computing paradigms available nowadays. Its adoption has increased during last years due to the large investment and research from business enterprises and academia institutions. Among all the services cloud providers usually offer, Infrastructure as a Service has reached its momentum for solving HPC problems in a more dynamic way without the need of expensive investments. The integration of a large number of providers is a major goal as it enables the improvement of the quality of the selected resources in terms of pricing, speed, redundancy, etc. In this paper, we propose a system architecture, based on semantic solutions, to build an interoperable scheduler for federated clouds that works with several IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) providers in a uniform way. Based on this architecture we implement a proof-of-concept prototype and test it with two different cloud solutions to provide some experimental results about the viability of our approach. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud platforms are increasingly being used for hosting a broad diversity of services from traditional e-commerce applications to interactive web-based Ides. How-ever, we observe that the proliferation of offers by cloud providers raises several challenges. Developers will not only have to deploy applications for a specific cloud, but will also have to consider migrating services from one cloud to another, and to manage distributed applications spanning multiple clouds. In this paper, we present our federated multi-cloud PaaS infrastructure for addressing these challenges. This infrastructure is based on three foundations: i) an open service model used to design and implement both our multi-cloud PaaSand the SaaS applications running on top of it, ii) a configurable architecture of the federated PaaS, and iii) some infrastructure services for managing both our multi-cloud PaaS and the SaaS applications. We then show how this multi-cloud PaaS can be deployed on top of thirteen existing IaaS/PaaS. We finally report on three distributed SaaS applications developed with and deployed on our federated multi-cloud PaaS infrastructure. © 2012 IEEE.},

The integration of well established grid infrastructures with cloud systems also fosters their complementary usage, simplified migration of applications, as well as efficient resource utilization. In this paper, we compare the layered conceptual grid model to the service model of clouds. Based on this comparison, we describe pragmatic possibilities to integrate cloud and grid systems. We analyze the connectivity options on the infrastructure level to gain access to both infrastructures using a unified client. In two case studies, we show the successful integration of the Amazon Web Services cloud with UNICORE~6 and the open source cloud Eucalyptus with Globus Toolkit~4.

abstract={In most enterprises, utilisation of available computing power of personal computers (PC) is very low, and it is desirable to improve it without incurring side effects. Architecture of most existing IaaS frameworks is inadequate for said scenario involving PCs. These frameworks are mainly designed for server-class computing infrastructure of large data centres. They typically make assumptions about hypervisor type and related environment setup. Various aspects of virtual machine (VM) control are largely controlled by cloud front-end node. However, in the said scenario involving PCs, hypervisor is often a hosted type which runs as a regular operating system (OS) process. A novel architecture for infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud is proposed to addresses above said limitations. It makes use of realtime system-state information from cluster nodes and decentralises cluster node policy management, among other design decisions. We show that proposed architecture has better scalability, security, and availability. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Emergency care is basically concerned with the provision of pre-hospital and in-hospital medical and/or paramedical services and it typically involves a wide variety of interdependent and distributed activities that can be interconnected to form emergency care processes within and between Emergency Medical Service (EMS) agencies and hospitals. Hence, in developing an information system for emergency care processes, it is essential to support individual process activities and to satisfy collaboration and coordination needs by providing readily access to patient and operational information regardless of location and time. Filling this information gap by enabling the provision of the right information, to the right people, at the right time fosters new challenges, including the specification of a common information format, the interoperability among heterogeneous institutional information systems or the development of new, ubiquitous trans-institutional systems. This paper is concerned with the development of an integrated computer support to emergency care processes by evolving and cross-linking institutional healthcare systems. To this end, an integrated EMS cloud-based architecture has been developed that allows authorized users to access emergency case information in standardized document form, as proposed by the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) profile, uses the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) standard Emergency Data Exchange Language (EDXL) Hospital Availability Exchange (HAVE) for exchanging operational data with hospitals and incorporates an intelligent module that supports triaging and selecting the most appropriate ambulances and hospitals for each case. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Anticipating this, cloud governance, a step forward from SOA governance, tries to consolidate an environment where collaboration between various enterprises can be easily achieved. Cloud governance lays the groundwork for enabling easy application development and deployment by providing critical services that range from service management to security, monitoring and audit. As means of support for cloud computing, several ontologies have tried to bridge gaps and provide interoperability. None, however, have taken the time to analyze and define aspects that relate to service lifecycle and cloud governance.

abstract={Cloud computing has reached a high level of acceptance, both in academia and in industry. The maturity of the technology, along with the considerable business opportunity that has been promised, is the main responsible for its success. Nevertheless, today only few, very big players dominate the commercial panorama and take over market shares. From that position, they impose rigid pricing policies and quite inflexible negotiation schemes. When the ongoing cloud standardization process will complete, and thus full interoperability among clouds will be accomplished, new players will come into play. A real competition among cloud providers will then start based on key factors like the capability of providing flexible services tailored to specific, fine-grained customers' requirements. In this market scenario a mechanism must be devised to support the matchmaking between what providers offer and what customers demand. In this work we define a semantic model to help customers and providers to characterize their demands/offers, and propose the use of semantic tools to perform the matchmaking in such a way to maximize both the provider's and the customer's satisfaction. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We show how a layered Cloud service model of software (SaaS), platform (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS) leverages multiple independent Clouds by creating a federation among the providers. The layered architecture leads naturally to a design in which inter-Cloud federation takes place at each service layer, mediated by a broker specific to the concerns of the parties at that layer. Federation increases consumer value for and facilitates providing IT services as a commodity. This business model for the Cloud is consistent with broker mediated supply and service delivery chains in other commodity sectors such as finance and manufacturing. Concreteness is added to the federated Cloud model by considering how it works in delivering the Weather Research and Forecasting service (WRF) as SaaS using PaaS and IaaS support. WRF is used to illustrate the concepts of delegation and federation, the translation of service requirements between service layers, and inter-Cloud broker functions needed to achieve federation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Learning one or more foreign languages is very important for students whose native language is not English. However, classroom learning, as the traditional and the most frequently-used learning mode, is difficult to improve students' practical ability in using foreign languages. Cloud learning is an emerging learning mode. It derives from cloud computing and E-Learning and has some advantages that classroom learning doesn't have. In order to establish a more efficient learning environment for foreign language learners, a new cloud learning environment (CLE) is proposed in this paper. The CLE is designed on the basis of Moodle. Its principle, structure, function and implementation etc. are also presented. The CLE has been used by 186 students who have basic cloud learning conditions. Practical application shows that the CLE has extended the learning time and raised the learning efficiency due to its features which include portability, interoperability and reusability etc. Meanwhile, it has also been proved that cloud learning and classroom learning are perfectly complementary in enhancing foreign language learning.},

abstract={In an age of cloud computing, users do not access a particular system, but a service. In a more centralized and seamless environment, it becomes important to view software as a service, or "SaaS". In particular, ubiquitous healthcare urgently needs to reflect the view of the healthcare system as a service, "HaaS", for the purposes of health promotion, disease prevention, and general well-being. Overcoming the current limitations of medical technologies, medical practices, and business, HaaS requires a more sustainable environment, including addressing issues of interoperability, service reuse, maintenance, and integration. This paper suggests a framework for realizing a HaaS model, focusing on vital signs-oriented systems. The proposed framework consists of four distinct modules: three modules for receiving, transforming, and analyzing vital signs and the fourth module, called a service-oriented architecture (SOA) component module, enabling access to medical services. We believe that the framework promises dramatic reductions in software development costs on the one hand and lays a foundation for users to access a rich and seamless service in a more convenient way on the other. This paper describes a framework for the HaaS model and presents an example service that we implemented, a calorie-tracking service, based on it. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Web information systems are at a point where certain technologies and practices have reached a mature level of development and adoption by the industry. These information systems are widespread in institutions with different contexts and scopes, but in a global world, these systems have interoperation needs through standards that define ways to distribute high quality contents or services. On the other hand, there is an increasing number of new web technologies, tools and kinds of contents, devices and services that thrive outside the world of institutions. These have to be combined with new models of distributing, delivering and accessing services: Open Resources, Open Source Software and Creative Commons Licenses, and even the "freemium" business models, which companies like Google, Layers, Prezzi or Twitter have adopted, presenting a deep impact on the panorama of Internet services. This special issue is devoted to the problem of how to integrate service based tools and contents, mobile applications and cloud computing services into the legacy systems. Systems that institutions have been implementing and putting to use with loss of effort and internal transformations; now realizing that their systems are limited, closed and far away from the crest of the wave of systems innovation. This is a problem whose solution seems to lie in the domain of Service Sciences, both from a technical point of view of SOA and interoperability standards, and from a point of view of business models, ways of collaboration inside software development teams and fair licensing strategies.

abstract={Google Docs is a well-known suite of online collaborative tools for document processing, spreadsheets, online presentations, drawing and even forms. The last versions of the major open source LMS Moodle, offers weak integrations with Google Docs treating it as a content repository. But these integrations are neglecting the collaborative qualities of the Google Docs suite and its potential as a learning activity within the LMS course. This paper presents an integration proposal that using the IMS Basic Learning Tools Interoperability (IMS BLTI) standard turns Google Docs into an engine that powers collaborative learning activities within the LMS Moodle. © J.UCS.},

abstract={Cloud computing is emerging as a major trend in the ICT industry. While most of the attention of the research community is focused on considering the perspective of the Cloud providers, offering mechanisms to support scaling of resources and interoperability and federation between Clouds, the perspective of developers and operators willing to choose the Cloud without being strictly bound to a specific solution is mostly neglected. We argue that Model-Driven Development can be helpful in this context as it would allow developers to design software systems in a cloud-agnostic way and to be supported by model transformation techniques into the process of instantiating the system into specific, possibly, multiple Clouds. The MODAClouds (MOdel-Driven Approach for the design and execution of applications on multiple Clouds) approach we present here is based on these principles and aims at supporting system developers and operators in exploiting multiple Clouds for the same system and in migrating (part of) their systems from Cloud to Cloud as needed. MODAClouds offers a quality-driven design, development and operation method and features a Decision Support System to enable risk analysis for the selection of Cloud providers and for the evaluation of the Cloud adoption impact on internal business processes. Furthermore, MODAClouds offers a run-time environment for observing the system under execution and for enabling a feedback loop with the design environment. This allows system developers to react to performance fluctuations and to re-deploy applications on different Clouds on the long term. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The advent of the cloud era has yielded new ways of storing, accessing and managing data. Cloud storage services enable the storage of data in an inexpensive, secure, fast, reliable and highly scalable manner over the internet. Although giant providers such as Amazon and Google have made a great success of their services, many enterprises and scientists are still unable to make the transition into the cloud environment due to often insurmountable issues of privacy, data protection and vendor lock-in. These issues demand that it be possible for anyone to setup or to build their own storage solutions that are independent of commercially available services. However, the question persists as to how to provide an effective cloud storage service with regards to system architecture, resource management mechanisms, data reliability and durability, as well as to provide proper pricing models. The aim of this research is to present an in-depth understanding and analysis of the key features of generic cloud storage services, and of how such services should be constructed and provided. This is achieved through the demonstration of design rationales and the implementation details of a real cloud storage system (CACSS). The method by which different technologies can be combined to provide a single excellent performance, highly scalable and reliable cloud storage system is also detailed. This research serves as a knowledge source for inexperienced cloud providers, giving them the capability of swiftly setting up their own cloud storage services.},

abstract={Cloud computing has the promise of significant benefits that include reduced costs, improved service provisioning, and a move to a pay-per-use model. However, there also are many challenges to successfully delivering cloud-based services; including security, data ownership, interoperability, service maturity and return on investment. These challenges need to be understood and managed before attempting to take advantage of what the cloud has to offer. In this paper we introduce a nine-step cloud life cycle that can be used for both the migration and the ongoing management of public, cloud-based services. A consortium of organizations using an open-innovation approach developed the life cycle. This paper describes each step of the life cycle in terms of the key challenges faced, and the recommended activities, with resultant outputs, needed to overcome them.},

abstract={The fast emerging Cloud computing market over the last years resulted in a variety of heterogeneous and less interoperable Cloud infrastructures. This leads to a challenging and urgent problem for Cloud users when selecting their best fitting Cloud provider and hence it ties them to a particular provider. A new growing research paradigm, which envisions a network of interconnected and interoperable Clouds through the use of open standards, is Intercloud computing. This allows users to easily migrate their application workloads across Clouds regardless of the underlying used Cloud provider platform. A very promising future use case of Intercloud computing is Cloud services brokerage. In this paper, we propose a generic architecture for a Cloud service broker operating in an Intercloud environment by using the latest Cloud standards. The broker aims to find the most suitable Cloud provider while satisfying the users' service requirements in terms of functional and non-functional Service Level Agreement parameters. After discussing the broker value-added services, we present in detail the broker design. We focus especially on how the expected SLA management and resource interoperability functionalities are included in the broker. Finally, we present a realistic simulation testbed to validate and evaluate the proposed architecture.},

abstract={To date a few, big providers dominate the market of Cloud resources. They provide proprietary solutions through inflexible pricing and SLA schemes. On the research side, the community is working to define specifications and standards on several aspects of the cloud technology. When standards will get mature, interoperability among clouds will be a reality. Customers will be no more locked-up to any proprietary technology and new players will have the chance to enter the market. The competition challenge will be played on the real capability of providers to accommodate customers' requests in a flexible way and to supply high and differentiated QoS levels. In this market scenario a mechanism must be devised to support the matchmaking between what providers offer and what customers' applications demand. In this work we propose the definition of a semantic model that helps customers and providers to characterize their demands/offers, and provide semantic tools performing the matchmaking in such a way to maximize both the provider's profit and the customer's utility.},

abstract={Nowadays, the competition in the telecommunications market is exciting and new entities with value-added services have emerged over the core network of Telecommunications operators (Telcos). These new participants have taken out the operators' relevance since they are entirely agnostic from infrastructure service connectivity. Therefore Telcos, like Portugal Telecom Inovação (PTIN), need to focus on the provision of services to a user's point of view to not become just a dumb-pipe between the consumers and Cloud service providers. This paper proposes a definition of a distributed architecture that allows developers to create and expose services through a Service Delivery Platform (SDP). The benefit of such Cloud-enabled SDP architecture is the portability of service enablers between Platform-as-a- Service (PaaS) providers through a standardized API. Service developers may thus select the more suitable PaaS offering in order to build on-top applications, based on the performance required by a service. An example of applications which can take advantage from more versatile Cloud platforms, is the delivery of mobile context-aware services that react to both environment and user conditions selecting the right type of content (e.g. photos, videos, etc.) to deliver.},

abstract={With the advance of cloud computing, the trend of developing and deploying applications on cloud environment also has appeared recently. There are economic as well as technological reasons why an application should be developed and deployed on the cloud. Reducing costs and business agility are typical business factors for cloud-based applications. Cloud computing can provide significant cost savings because of the increased utilization resulting from the pooling of resources. In addition, this technology enables rapid delivery of IT services, which also improves business efficiency. On the operational side, manageability, performance, and scalability are the typical reasons why application developers consider cloud computing. However, cloud computing is still considerable complex to use. Not only the migration between clouds is difficult - but also the development and deployment of a new, complex service from the beginning could be quite a challenge using today's cloud computing. In this paper, novel high-level abstraction layers for cloud computing is presented. The abstraction layers will allow users to manage cloud resources form various clouds and simplify the process of developing and deploying services into those clouds. This approach will also solve absolutely the interoperability issue, thus improving the flexibility of cloud computing.},

abstract={System management is becoming increasingly complex and brings high costs, especially with the advent of cloud computing. Cloud computing involves numerous platforms often of virtual machines (VMs) and middleware has to be managed to make the whole system work cost-effectively after an application is deployed. In order to reduce management costs, in particular for the manual activities, many computer programs have been developed remove or reduce the complexity and difficulty of system mamnagement. These programs are usually hard-coded in languages like Java and C++, which bring enough capability and flexibility but also cause high programming effort and cost. This paper proposes an architecture for developing management programs in a simple but powerful way. First of all, the manageability of a given platform (via APIs, configuration files, and scripts) is abstracted as a runtime model of the platform's software architecture, which can automatically and immediately propagate any observable runtime changes of the target platforms to the corresponding architecture models, and vice versa. The management programs are developed using modeling languages, instead of those relatively low-level programming languages. Architecture-level management programs bring many advantages related to performance, interoperability, reusability, and simplicity. An experiment on a real-world cloud deployment and comparisonwith traditional programming language approaches demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and benefits of the new model based approach for management program development. © 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper presents an approach to programming and running scientific applications on grid and cloud infrastructures based on two principles: the first one is to follow a component-based programming model, the second is to apply a flexible technology which allows for virtualization of the underlying infrastructure. The solutions described in this paper include high-level composition and deployment consisting of a scripting-based environment and a manager system based on an architecture description language (ADL), a dynamically managed pool of component containers, and interoperability with other component models such as Grid Component Model (GCM). We demonstrate how the proposed methodology can be implemented by combining the unique features of the Common Component Architecture (CCA) model together with the H2O resource sharing platform, resulting in the MOCCA component framework. Applications and tests include data mining using the Weka library, Monte Carlo simulation of the formation of clusters of gold atoms, as well as a set of synthetic benchmarks. The conclusion is that the component approach to scientific applications can be successfully applied to both grid and cloud infrastructures. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={Over the last years, interoperability among resources has been emerged as one of the most challenging research topics. However, the commonality of the complexity of the architectures (e.g., heterogeneity) and the targets that each computational paradigm - including HPC, grids and clouds - aims to achieve (e.g., fl exibility) remain the same. This is to effi ciently orchestrate resources in a distributed computing fashion by bridging the gap among local and remote participants. Initially, this is closely related with the scheduling concept which is one of the most important issues for designing a cooperative resource management system, especially in large scale settings such as in grids and clouds. Within this context, meta-scheduling offers additional functionalities in the area of interoperable resource management, this is because of its great agility to handle sudden variations and dynamic situations in user demands. Accordingly, the case of inter-infrastructures, including InterCloud, entitle that the decentralised meta-scheduling scheme overcome issues like consolidated administration management, bottleneck and local information exposition. In this work, we detail the fundamental issues for developing an effective interoperable meta-scheduler for e-infrastructures in general and InterCloud in particular. Finally, we describe a simulation and experimental confi guration based on real grid workload traces to demonstrate the interoperable setting as well as provide experimental results as part of a strategic plan for integrating future meta-schedulers. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Identity security and privacy have been regarded as one of the top seven cloud security threats. There are a few identity management solutions proposed recently trying to tackle these problems. However, none of these can satisfy all desirable properties. In particular, unlinkability ensures that none of the cloud service providers (CSPs), even if they collude, can link the transactions of the same user. On the other hand, delegatable authentication is unique to the cloud platform, in which several CSPs may join together to provide a packaged service, with one of them being the source provider which interacts with the clients and performs authentication while the others will be transparent to the clients. Note that CSPs may have different authentication mechanisms that rely on different attributes. Moreover, each CSP is limited to see only the attributes that it concerns. This paper presents SPICE - the first digital identity management system that can satisfy these properties in addition to other desirable properties. The novelty of our scheme stems from combining and exploiting two group signatures so that we can randomize the signature to make the same signature look different for multiple uses of it and hide some parts of the messages which are not the concerns of the CSP. Our scheme is quite applicable to cloud systems due to its simplicity and efficiency. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Although the service is useful, there are three problems; latency, non-availability and privacy due to vendor lock-in. MyCloud constructs a high-performance, secure distributed storage system by using some vendors' Cloud Computing in parallel. MyCloud has three contributions. First, MyCloud can construct the highly available storage. For example, non-working time is thirty-one milliseconds using three public clouds. Second, MyCloud strongly preserves privacy to encrypt and to distribute user data to several vendors cloud. Third, MyCloud translates thirteen times faster than normal cloud storage services. This paper argues how to develop MyCloud and experimental results for estimating the availability and the down load-speed of MyCloud. MyCloud would make the secure, available and useful Cloud Computing future.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is the blending technology of parallel and distributing computing paradigm, and its main aim is providing Everything as a Service (XaaS) to the consumers. The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is one type of service models in Cloud Computing to provide infrastructure to the customers. The private cloud is one of the deployment models in cloud computing, and it offers resources to the consumers in an on-demand manner within or inside the organization. It is managed by different type of cloud middleware's and each them have their own mechanism and protocols. So there is an interoperability issue between these different type of private clouds, to solve this issue it is essential to describe a common mechanism. In this paper, we have devised a a broker based architectural framework to solve the interoperability issue between the Eucalyptus and OpenNebula based private clouds. The proposed work has incorporated with semantic based resource description and discovery, capacity based resource selection and resource provisioning mechanism. The proposed framework solves the interoperability between private clouds, enhances the efficiency of cloud resources, increases the scheduling success rate resulting in increase of throughput of application requests submitted to the resource broker in a better manner. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The properties of BIM are; parametric modelling providing tabular views of components and characteristic interaction with elements, for example if a pitch roof changes so do the walls and bi-directional co-ordination enabling virtual simulations of physical construction. However, the dilemma is how to share these properties of BIM applications on one single platform. Thus creating a service that would enable the end-user to use multiple of nDs such as, 3D (three dimensional modelling), 4D (time - programming), 5D (costing) and 6D (sustainability) actions asynchronously. The prospect of using remote data servers with web service applications provides a mechanism for exchanging data openly. The main exchange format for BIM files is Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the initial problem with IFCs is that they are not intended to store and carry all relevant data for all multi-featured construction processes. Furthermore, not all relevant data can be structured in a single super schema. This papers' methodology focuses on the results of a semi-structured interview of 11 expert respondents, on using cloud computing as integration platform for BIM applications 'Cloud BIM'. The proposed model is not to introduce a new schema in contrast to IFC but to harness the capability of IFC XML and or possibly engage with using Simplified Markup Language (SML) subsets of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) for exchanging partial data to design an integrated platform that would enhance the BIM usability experience for various disciplines in making key design decisions at a relatively early design stage. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The evolution of IP networks to a service-oriented paradigm poses new challenges to service providers regarding the management and auditing of network services. The upward trend in ubiquity, heterogeneity and virtualization of network services and resources demands for a formal and systematic approach to network management tasks. In this context, the semantic characterization and modeling of services provided to users is a key component to sustain autonomic service management, service negotiation and configuration. The semantic and formal description of services and resources is also relevant to assist paradigms such as cloud computing, where a large diversity of resources have to be described and managed in a highly dynamic way. This paper defines an ontology for multiservice IP networks targeting multiple service management goals, namely: (i) to foster client and service provider interoperability; (ii) to manage network service contracts, promoting the dynamic negotiation between parties; (iii) to access and query SLA/SLSs data on a individual or aggregated basis to assist service provisioning in the network; and (iv) to sustain service monitoring and auditing. A ServiceModel API is provided to take full advantage of the proposed semantic model, allowing Service Management Platforms to access the ontological contents. This ontological development takes advantage of SWRL to discover new knowledge, enriching the possibilities of systems described using this support. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we present an approach intending to meet these needs by (1) easing security configuration(s), (2) automating the consideration of security best practices and adding/enabling anonymity components at-runtime, and (3) by using Open Virtualization Format (OVF) in order to overcome the vendor lock-in problem. The requirements gathering is based on the needs of three projects from different business domains, the EU FP7 digital.me project, the multidisciplinary iFishWatcher/iAngle combined project and the joint german-french research and development project ReSCUe IT. All projects require empowering lay as well as experienced customers to (re-)deploy their own applications and migrate them easily by considering security thereby. Supporting tailorability of the deployed environment by adding anonymity components at-runtime without downtimes is a specific requirement in these projects. We present first results and discuss experiences and future work directions. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={During the last years, the cloud computing technology has emerged as a new way to obtain computing resources on demand in a very dynamic fashion and only paying for what you consume. Nowadays, there are several hosting providers which follow this approach, offering resources with different capabilities, prices and SLAs. Therefore, depending on the users' preferences and the application requirements, a resource provider can fit better with them than another one. In this paper, we present an architecture for federating clouds, aggregating resources from different providers, deciding which resources and providers are the best for the users' interests, and coordinating the application deployment in the selected resources giving to the user the impression that a single cloud is used.},

abstract={Cloud Interoperability has been a core issue pertaining Intercloud and Cloud Federation. Several vendor-based proprietary solutions and open-source middleware are present for the resolution; however, these solutions are highly coupled to particular cloud environments. For heterogeneous clouds to exist in an interoperable environment, the need of a vendor-independent, secure and reliable message exchange middleware is critical. In this paper, considering general cloud architecture, we are presenting a Publish-Subscribe based middleware for Intercloud Message Exchange. Intercloud Message Exchange is an implementation of Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS's reliable pub-sub messaging in conjunction with our devised Information Model can be a novel candidate for messaging domain of Intercloud Interoperability Standards. This Information Model also hosts an OWL based Cloud Resource Description Ontology, utilized by cloud environments for resource cataloguing and possible matchmaking prior to workload migration between heterogeneous clouds. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Background: Over the past decade the workflow system paradigm has evolved as an efficient and user-friendly approach for developing complex bioinformatics applications. Two popular workflow systems that have gained acceptance by the bioinformatics community are Taverna and Galaxy. Each system has a large user-base and supports an ever-growing repository of application workflows. However, workflows developed for one system cannot be imported and executed easily on the other. The lack of interoperability is due to differences in the models of computation, workflow languages, and architectures of both systems. This lack of interoperability limits sharing of workflows between the user communities and leads to duplication of development efforts.Results: In this paper, we present Tavaxy, a stand-alone system for creating and executing workflows based on using an extensible set of re-usable workflow patterns. Tavaxy offers a set of new features that simplify and enhance the development of sequence analysis applications: It allows the integration of existing Taverna and Galaxy workflows in a single environment, and supports the use of cloud computing capabilities. The integration of existing Taverna and Galaxy workflows is supported seamlessly at both run-time and design-time levels, based on the concepts of hierarchical workflows and workflow patterns. The use of cloud computing in Tavaxy is flexible, where the users can either instantiate the whole system on the cloud, or delegate the execution of certain sub-workflows to the cloud infrastructure.Conclusions: Tavaxy reduces the workflow development cycle by introducing the use of workflow patterns to simplify workflow creation. It enables the re-use and integration of existing (sub-) workflows from Taverna and Galaxy, and allows the creation of hybrid workflows. Its additional features exploit recent advances in high performance cloud computing to cope with the increasing data size and complexity of analysis.The system can be accessed either through a cloud-enabled web-interface or downloaded and installed to run within the user's local environment.

abstract={Cloud computing and IPv6 are among two of the most prominent trends impacting the IT industry. In order to fully use heterogeneous network resources, there is a need to design a network where all resources can interconnect in cloud computing deployment. At present, IPv4 networks are still dominant and IPv6 is the next internet protocol that is being adopted. In cloud computing deployment, IPv6 is the solution for mobility and is seen to have a good impact in cloud computing network deployment. Due to the difficulty associated with upgrading the entire Internet backbone to support IPv6 it is easy to upgrade routers in the access network and allow for the greater benefits of IPv6 than to upgrade all routers in the Internet backbone network. To integrate both IPv4 and IPv6 interoperability for cloud computing there is a need of Translation Protocol and Tunneling mechanisms. In this paper, we proposed an IPv4 and IPv6 interoperability framework for cloud computing deployment.},

At times, single cloud service provider would be saturated or running out of resources and may be unable to provide the services to its client, resulting in poor scalability and reliability. It may tarnish the trust parameter of customer. In addition, there is huge investment in setting up a single scalable cloud, which in turn has many environmental impacts. In this work, we propose an architecture to inter-connect different clouds in P2P fashion to address the problems like efficiency bottleneck and single point of failure that are predominantly associated with traditional approaches. This idea gives access to much larger pools of resources/services. Each provider can maximize their profit by creating new collaborative services. These capabilities can be available and tradable through a service catalogue to support innovations and applications. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Cloud computing can provide the services to the customer without investing an amount for upgrading a resource at the client end, because everything is available in the centralized server called cloud. The security issue is the main drawback of the cloud services which leads to the customer feel uncomfortable. There are different levels of cloud security available in the cloud computing but it not satisfies the cloud customers. The exiting cloud based security concentrates only on the network level. Cloud need application level defense in order to secure the cloud application more effectively. The proposed approch uses the registry with tag which provides security over the application for ensuring the authorization of the services. There are two registry had introduced namely service registry and certification registry. Service registry can have the details of the CSP with related information whereas the certification registry holds the information which is required for authorization during cloud service request. The uncertain factor of the cloud security like fake reported suspicious information has not been addressed in the previous work. The lack of interoperability over the cloud will leads to service delay, inconsistent security assessment of the services and decision making process. In order to achieve smooth contact between the customer and provider by proposing the novel framework this will help in the cloud security. The common deployment model also introduced for providing the security on the software applications to improve the customer retention and quality level of the services. In future the multilevel of security will be applied over the application like financial application. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

abstract={Current Web grows rapidly to several directions (from the Web of Documents to the Webs of Humans, Things, Services, Knowledge, Intelligence, etc.). Consequently the recent and future Web-based applications, systems and frameworks (like, e.g., Social and Ubiquitous Computing, SOA and Cloud Computing, etc.) should take into account challenges related to extremely high heterogeneity of components and exponentially increased complexity of a business logic connecting and making them interoperable. Enabling self-management enhanced with semantic technology seems to be an only option to handle that. We suggest adding a "virtual representative" to every resource in the Web to solve the global interoperability problem. Intelligent agent (a kind of "software robot") will act, communicate and collaborate as a proxy on behalf of each Web resource. It will be connected with its resource via "semantic adapter", will communicate with other agents via "semantic communication" and will be coordinated via "semantic business logic". The relevant "Global Understanding Environment" (GUN) vision of Industrial Ontologies Group will be briefly presented. It can be considered as a kind of ubiquitous eco-system, which will be such proactive, self-managed evolutionary Semantic Web of Everything where all kinds of entities are assumed to understand, interact, serve, develop and learn from each other. The key set of enabling technologies for the GUN vision implementation includes: Artificial Intelligence; Semantic and Agent technologies; SOA and Cloud Computing.

abstract={In the past few years, we have witnessed the proliferation of a heterogeneous ecosystem of cloud providers, each one with a different infrastructure offer and pricing policy. We explore this heterogeneity in a novel cloud brokering approach that optimizes placement of virtual infrastructures across multiple clouds and also abstracts the deployment and management of infrastructure components in these clouds. The feasibility of our approach is evaluated in a high throughput computing cluster case study. Experimental results confirm that multi-cloud deployment provides better performance and lower costs compared to the usage of a single cloud only. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The vendor lock-in is one of the challenges which have been affected the Cloud Computing adoption. Considering that each provider has different features, the vendor lock-in avoids the migration of an application among providers (portability). Likewise, different providers are not able to collaborate among themselves (interoperate). Considering the separation between specification and implementation, and considering that an electronic contract can drive an interorganizational business process, we argue that a contract can be used to drive the portability and interoperability process in Cloud Computing. This paper shows the first steps towards an approach based on electronic contract to support the portability and interoperability among Clouds. This approach will support: (i) the creation of federated Clouds; (ii) the collaboration between private and public Clouds; and (iii) the application portability.},

abstract={In the last few years, in spite of concerns about the hype, cloud computing has expanded steadily both horizontally - across industries, and vertically - in organizations' technology stacks. Most technologies that enable cloud services existed prior to cloud computing's existence, although these days they rejuvenate, evolve and stimulate the computational ecosystem transformations. Actually the radical change for organizations is in rethinking and reengineering their traditional IT resources advancing them with cloud architectures and implementing services based on cloud computing delivery models. The change is underway on a large scale: from vendors and developers to providers and customers, and the key issues of "cloudiness" are not only in economics and management, but in provisioning, interoperability and security of the integrated services. The Cloud Computing phenomenon likewise creates exciting challenges and opportunities for the entire educational system. For faculty, students, administration, and IT professionals it is a thrilling journey driven by many agendas-cost cutting, delivering dynamic mobile and interactive computational services, utilizing and leveraging integrated IT infrastructures and systems. This talk will explore the impact of cloud computing on the educational socio-technical system and will provide the author's experience in strategizing and utilizing cloud-based applications and services. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm that can abstract various computer resources and make the resources as services easily accessible to people. Meanwhile, cloud computing provides people with the resources in a pay-as-you-go style, i.e. charging for the use of resources. However, cloud computing cannot make people use everything in a cloud without caring about their own investments and resources. While cloud computing nowadays only cares about how to rent resources to people, people need a solution capable of combining their own resources and the rented resources to get the maximum benefit, i.e. the solution to customize a cloud according to peoples needs. In this paper, the PROgram Ultra-Dispatcher (PROUD) is proposed for launching applications in a customization manner on cloud computing. The PROUD allows people to configure using their own computers or Virtual Machines (VMs) in clouds to run applications, no matter the applications are installed in peoples computers or VMs in clouds. The PROUD allows people to regulate a rule for determining what computer or VM is capable of running the application according to available run-time information such as CPU utilization, available memory, network activity, disk space or I/O activity, etc. Furthermore, the PROUD allows people to setup preference to affect the decision procedure of choosing a capable computer or VM. Functioning as a program loader in peoples computers, the PROUD has high interoperability among VMs to work well without a limitation in using the same Cloud Service Providers VMs. Because people usually rent parts of pay-as-you-go resources in clouds such as a couple of VMs, the PROUD is justified to be a solution capable of combining their own resources and the rented resources to get the maximum benefit. Currently, the PROUD is implemented on Windows XP with a script file written in a portable language, so the PROUD has high portability among Windows platforms and high acceptability to people who are familiar with Windows platforms. The PROUD is given experiments in this paper to identify its practicability, overhead, and performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For education, it offers new possibilities to structure and perform learning processes. In this study, the potential impact of cloud computing on education is analyzed, showing what it means for educators and students as well as institutions, and summarized under the heading 'Generation C', where C stands for cloud. The results of the study revealed that cloud computing can be used by educators, institutions, and individual students as well as by jurisdiction to support particular teaching and learning experiences and to organize software availability. Challenges for educators and institutions using cloud computing in teaching could be summarized under the following keywords: interoperability and transferability, terms and conditions, security and privacy issues, backup and perpetuity, denial of service and content issues. On a whole, some implications of using cloud computing need to be kept in mind, good understanding of the applications in use, development of guidelines for use and migration strategies as well as the implementation of risk management could allow educators and institutions to take advantage of cloud computing, in turn offering rich online learning experiences for students.},

The paper suggests a modern solution to economic organizations in order to increase their agility and economical development in the knowledge-based society. The solution is represented by the transition to service-oriented enterprise. The service-oriented enterprise requires a superior level of maturity of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) within the organization, along with the creation of an agile architecture. Thus, the first part of the paper points out the stages of SOA maturity within the organization, analyses the adoption of SOA according to several factors and identifies the major changes necessary to align the organization to SOA. The second part of the paper proposes an architectural model (based on SOA, Cloud Computing, Business Process Management and Case Management) for the service-oriented enterprise that eliminates the gap between the business level and the information system level, allows interoperability between business partners and increases enterprise agility.},

abstract={The speech will describe the recent evolutionary paths of European research about Enterprise Interoperability. In 2006, the Enterprise Interoperability cluster of European projects coined the term ISU (Interoperability Service Utility) as the new IT infrastructure able to provide interoperability services to all SMEs, at low cost and under non-rivalry and non-discriminatory principles. This concept has been studied and developed further by the COIN flagship Integrated Project (COllaboration and INteroperability for networked enterprises), coordinated by TXT e-solutions, which started in 2008 and developed a first prototype of ISU by means of a dynamic federation of open and trusted Generic Service Delivery Platforms as well as envisaging a set of innovative business models for Enterprise Interoperability as a Service-Utility. More recently, the advent of EU 2020 Strategy and Digital Agenda for Europe confirmed the importance of having “interoperability and standards” as one of the most important pillars for a single digital market for European citizens and enterprises. This evident commoditization trend could induce readers to think that in 10 years time interoperability will not matter anymore (N. Carr “IT does not matter”) and that it will soon be absorbed by Cloud Computing and Future Internet as one of the fundamental services of a so-called Universal Business System. However, more and more eminent scientists tend now to agree that it is when a technology really becomes a utility and apparently does not matter anymore (Z. Turk calls it sedimentation) that innovation could find the most fertile and promising ground to develop and grow. Based on the sound and solid base of Future Internet core platform and enterprise interoperability utility infrastructure, a new project, MSEE (Manufacturing SErvice Ecosystem), coordinated by TXT and started in October 2011, is now trying to explore how the commoditization and openness of IT could become an enabler for service innovation in the manufacturing industry, allowing virtual factories and enterprises to adopt a value co-creation and service dominant logic instead of a traditional perspective of producing and selling just physical goods. It is thanks to Enterprise Modelling and Interoperability as an integrated part of a Universal Business System that a milling machine industry could sell “holes per minute” or that an aircraft engine industry could sell “flying hours” or that a traditional car manufacturer could sell “mobility kilometers”. As a future perspective, the speech will also address the key question whether technical-service-business innovation, implemented for instance by the Factories of the Future and the MSEE project, could be sufficient for European manufacturing industry to overcome the current economic crisis or, instead, a re-thinking of skills and competencies of employees is needed in order to implement and take up the changes imposed by innovation. In this perspective, a new research initiative, coordinated by TXT and called TELL ME (Technology Enhanced Learning Livinglab for Manufacturing Environments), is going to be launched in November 2012 with the aim of implementing human-centric manufacturing and innovative methods and solutions for blue collar workers lifelong training, via open innovation and participative creativity Living Labs. © International Federation for Information Processing 2012.},

abstract={After receiving cancer treatment, patients often experience a decline of HRQoL (health-related quality of life). Physicians typically evaluate HRQoL during periodic clinical visits. However, out-patient reporting of vital signals between two visits could be used to interpret the decline of HRQoL. Considering that the vast majority of patients recovering from cancer are not in hospitals, it is often impractical for the care providers to collect these data. In this paper, we design and prototype caREMOTE, a cancer reporting and monitoring telemedicine system, which can be used in domestic cancer care. By extending a standard clinical trial informatics model, we build a prototype on cloud computing services that can be accessed by a mobile application. We aim to maximize the potential of caREMOTE to help medical practitioners efficiently monitor discharged patients' HRQoL and vital signals, and facilitate data reusability and system interoperability in future collaborative cancer research. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is a newly developed technology for complex system with large scale resource, information, software sharing with the help of agents. The persisting problem is in the assignment of data locks to the users in case of conflicts. This paper deals with a technique of handling data locks by providing a novel architecture lest a conflict occurs between the users. The architecture uses multiple agents including mobile agents and fixed agent. The proposed scheme enhances the speed of write lock assignment in the SaaAS (Software as an Agent Service) Environment quite efficiently with the help of passing few messages. It also takes a glance into the portability and interoperability of agents in a Cloud computing environment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This paper describes a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism for distributed High Performance Computing (HPC) systems that will facilitate scalable evaluation, management and enforcement of access control policies. The RBAC mechanism forms an enhanced security framework for Grids and Clouds that will allow for interoperability between technologies in the two domains. The mechanisms being proposed here are important because the current lack of software tools and security standards in accessing distributed HPC systems and transporting Large Data Sets can add immensely to overheads in data processing or data integration times. RBAC models make policy management scalable and by virtue of being modular allow for more sophisticated access control models to be integrated with them. This paper shows how existing security standards can be leveraged for the specification and management of RBAC policies with the aim to allow disparate applications, systems and security domains to interoperate. The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) can be used for policy specification and management across disparate organizations and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) can be used for authentication and authorization assertions across the same. Both standards can be leveraged to facilitate policy management and enforcement, and delegation of rights. Authorization servers like Shibboleth can be leveraged for use as RBAC system components. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing enables shared servers to provide resources, software and data for collaborative services on demand with high interoperability and scalability. However, there are a number of technical challenges that need to be tackled before these benefits can be fully realized, which include system reliability, resource provisioning, and efficient resources consuming, etc. Among them, load-balancing is a necessary mechanism to increase the service level agreement (SLA) and better uses of the resources. Unfortunately, servers' capability varies much in practice and is not easy to record in ordered positions in a server farm, which will causes non resource-aware load-balancing algorithms to distribute workloads evenly. We discuss this issue and show why such algorithms don't fit the cloud computing environment and then present a feasible resource-aware load-balancing mechanism by using existing proven technologies to meet higher SLA and the return of investment as well. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent advances in information technology make remote collaboration and resource sharing easier for next generation distributed systems, such as grids and clouds. One common model of study is the convergence of these systems, along with interclouds to a unified global computing resource. Despite similarities between grids and clouds, there are a number of fundamental differences that make this convergence process harder. For example, they negatively affect the possibility of a seamless intercloud federation on the path to convergence. Resource sharing in general and related communication methodologies, such as information dissemination, matchmaking, and so on, are also integral elements in this convergence process. This article proposes information proxies (i.e., proxies that disseminate information on behalf of a resource, or a collection of resources) to help make available resource state at 'distant' clouds where there is no direct control. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The idea behind cloud computing is to deliver Infrastructure-, Platform- and Software-as-a-Service (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) over the Internet on an easy pay-per-use business model. However, current offerings from cloud providers are based on proprietary technologies. As a consequence, consumers run into a risk of a vendor lock-in with little flexibility in moving their services to other providers. This can hinder the advancement of cloud computing to small- and medium-sized enterprises. To address these issues, standardization efforts have to take place in order to support further developments in the clouds. Standardized exchange mechanisms and interfaces are crucial in order to facilitate interoperability. In this paper, we look at several cloud standards, such as Open Virtualization Format, Open Cloud Computing Interface, and Cloud Data Management Interface, and analyze them against a taxonomy in order to point out their role for interoperability in IaaS. The taxonomy presents important IaaS topics, such as access mechanism, virtual appliance, security, and service-level agreement. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Creation of a secure, access controlled cloud computing environment is a step between the typical closed computing systems used for most DoD simulation events and the cloud computing offerings from companies such as Amazon and Google. Private cloud computing, such as described in this paper, is the best approach for creating an environment for serving software, platforms and infrastructure as a service when security, privacy and compliance are necessities. A primary driver for the creation of the environment discussed in this paper was the intent to create a cost-efficient approach that facilitated tool-sharing across the local simulation architectures and available hardware. As a side benefit, impediments for shared environments as identified in the DoD LVC Architecture Roadmap Study (2008) have begun to be mitigated at the local scale by serving software components that have been tested for compatibility. The result is the ability to easily provision virtualized hardware and software for an event with the risk of component incompatibilities being largely removed. Having the ability to conveniently have on-demand network access to a shared pool of virtualized computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services), as well as the ability to rapidly provision resources for a simulation event has minimized the management effort and has begun to reduce the cost for supporting simulation experiments and analysis.},

abstract={Cloud brokerage mechanisms are fundamental to reduce the complexity of using multiple cloud infrastructures to achieve optimal placement of virtual machines and avoid the potential vendor lock-in problems. However, current approaches are restricted to static scenarios, where changes in characteristics such as pricing schemes, virtual machine types, and service performance throughout the service life-cycle are ignored. In this paper, we investigate dynamic cloud scheduling use cases where these parameters are continuously changed, and propose a linear integer programming model for dynamic cloud scheduling. Our model can be applied in various scenarios through selections of corresponding objectives and constraints, and offers the flexibility to express different levels of migration overhead when restructuring an existing infrastructure. Finally, our approach is evaluated using commercial clouds parameters in selected simulations for the studied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that, with proper parametrizations, our approach is feasible. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The number of applications and services hosted in the cloud grows steadily, because of significant advantages in cost, flexibility, and scale compared to traditional IT. However, major difficulties in this field are (i) the migration of existing applications into the cloud and (ii) the increasing vendor lock-in which denotes the inability to leave a certain cloud provider without significant effort. Current approaches do not offer a holistic solution: Either they require the user to provide the application in a certain standardized way or they are only able to migrate one specific type of component. As a consequence, the migration of composite applications with different types of components is not supported. To overcome this limitation we propose the Cloud Motion Framework (CMotion) which leverages existing application models and provides support to migrate composite applications into and between clouds. Based on the application model, the framework evaluates alternative ways to host each component. CMotion assumes that the dependencies of components are modeled explicitly and the components are self-contained. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to features like on demand services, scalability and usage based pricing, today cloud computing has attracted many customers to move their applications to cloud. But cloud service providers are using different standards and frameworks which customer has to follow. There may be a case where customer wants to migrate data and application to another cloud service provider. In that case, code of application and structure of database must be modified according to the standard provided by new service provider which is very costly. This issue is regarded as cloud vendor lock-in. Work has already been done for providing techniques which can facilitate migration of data. But that technique is not providing support for transformation of query from one cloud to other. By taking Google App engine as one cloud service provider, algorithm can be developed to transform query supported by relational databases, SQL, to query supported by Google app engine datastore, Google Query Language (GQL). After that same algorithm can be generalized for any cloud datastore. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Productivity growth is probably the single most important indicator of an economy's health. In the UK construction industry the majority of waste is generated throughout the lifecycle of a building mainly due to limited accessibility to existing information. The use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) has proven instrumental in creating productivity gains within global markets, for example, through reduced transaction costs, scalability, and fast, reliable information flows, enhanced online collaboration tools and new ways to market goods and services. This paper will identify how future services such as, cloud computing and Build Information Modeling (BIM), can enable cost savings to the building industry by contributing to an increase in productivity through using open standards. The paper also identifies a working progress methodology section that has evolved from the results of the survey techniques used to date, based on cloud computing and BIM. The final section of the paper, uses two case studies to emphasize the potential cost savings benefits for the UK construction industry in implementing cloud computing and BIM.},

abstract={The evolution of the Next Generation Networks, especially the wireless broadband access technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), have increased the number of "all-IP" networks across the world. The enhanced capabilities of these access networks has spearheaded the cloud computing paradigm, where the end-users aim at having the services accessible anytime and anywhere. The services availability is also related with the end-user device, where one of the major constraints is the battery lifetime. Therefore, it is necessary to assess and minimize the energy consumed by the end-user devices, given its significance for the user perceived quality of the cloud computing services. In this paper, an empirical methodology to measure network interfaces energy consumption is proposed. By employing this methodology, an experimental evaluation of energy consumption in three different cloud computing access scenarios (including WiMAX) were performed. The empirical results obtained show the impact of accurate network interface states management and application network level design in the energy consumption. Additionally, the achieved outcomes can be used in further software-based models to optimized energy consumption, and increase the Quality of Experience (QoE) perceived by the end-users. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing offers both an opportunity and a challenge to the application interoperability. In a cloud computing environment, it may be easier to integrate software applications than in the traditional enterprise computing environment, if they all run on the same cloud platform, especially, on a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platform, following a common programming model. However, making multiple applications running on different computing clouds would make it more difficult to deal with multiple cloud platforms and their differences. This paper presents a novel service and data management platform called DSP (Data Service Portal) in the cloud computing environment that facilitates the integration of applications by sharing their information in a loosely coupled manner. DSP enables applications to collectively exchange data through a platform in a fine-grained access control environment. The applications can work cooperatively, through the data sharing mechanism provided by the platform playing the role of a data broker, without being aware of each other's presence. An individual application can maintain its own data and run independently of the other applications in the platform. The data sharing mechanism enables the applications to offer (or subscribe to) a set of data to be consumed by (or produced by) the other applications in the platform. The platform publishes the data model along with APIs and guidelines for applications to adapt to the DSP platform and get to on-board to the platform for the subscriptions. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is a new computing paradigm where a large amount of computing capacity is offered on demand and only paying for what you use. Several Infrastructure Providers have adopted this approach offering resources which are easily managed by means of web-based APIs. However, if a user wants to use different providers, the resource management becomes tedious because providers define different API requiring a special implementation for interacting with each of them. In this paper, we present a methodology for making the provider interoperability easier. In this methodology, each provider's API is modeled by an ontology. Equivalences between these ontologies are modeled by rules, and messages used in a provider's API are converted in calls to another provider's API applying these rules. With our approach, users interact with Infrastructure Providers using their most familiar API and the translation to the other APIs is automatically done by the system. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile technologies are drawing their attention to the cloud computing due to the increasing demand of the applications, for processing power, storage space and energy. However, developing mobile cloud applications involves working with services and APIs from different cloud vendors. Most often these APIs are not interoperable and the information processed and stored into the cloud is non-transferable across clouds. To counter these problems, a generic middleware framework, Mobile Cloud Middleware (MCM) is designed, which handles the interoperability issues, and eases the use of process-intensive services from mobile phones. A prototype of MCM is developed and several applications are demonstrated in different domains. Moreover, to verify the scalability of MCM, load tests are performed on the hybrid cloud resources. The detailed performance analysis of the middleware framework shows that MCM improves the quality of service for mobiles and helps in maintaining soft-real time responses for mobile cloud applications. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) infrastructure for industry logistics, which is normally constructed with the technology of SOA. We then propose a logistic cloud and design with service pools in it and discuss with some related works and references discussions. In the last section, we implement a SaaS-based global logistic tracking system (SGLTS) structure by abstract the web services in service pools in the Logistic Cloud designed in our research with explanations. Finally, we describe a typical system design and scenario in a normal logistic environment with design patterns of it. Logistic transportations in industries can equipped with different devices such as PCs, tablet PCs, laptops, personal digital assistants with Wireless LAN, 3G network and GPS facilities can be able to install the system with different platforms and can access the web services in the Logistic Cloud that we proposed in our research. Prototype systems that we implement in this paper can have better interoperability and reusability than former systems.},

abstract={This paper highlights the importance of the interoperability of the encrypted DB in terms of the characteristics of DB and efficient schemes. Although most prior researches have developed efficient algorithms under the provable security, they do not focus on the interoperability of the encrypted DB. In order to address this lack of practical aspects, we conduct two practical approaches--efficiency and group search in cloud datacenter. The process of this paper is as follows: first, we create two schemes of efficiency and group search--practical keyword index search--I and II; second, we define and analyze group search secrecy and keyword index search privacy in our schemes; third, we experiment on efficient performances over our proposed encrypted DB. As the result, we summarize two major results: (1)our proposed schemes can support a secure group search without re-encrypting all documents under the group-key update and (2)our experiments represent that our scheme is approximately 935 times faster than Golle's scheme and about 16 times faster than Song's scheme for 10,000 documents. Based on our experiments and results, this paper has the following contributions: (1) in the current cloud computing environments, our schemes provide practical, realistic, and secure solutions over the encrypted DB and (2) this paper identifies the importance of interoperability with database management system for designing efficient schemes. © 2011, Park et al; licensee Springer.},

abstract={Cloud computing provides a promising paradigm for the deployment and utilization of online resources including hardware and software services by Internet users. In such an e-infrastructure environment, the scheduling of user-defined tasks is always considered as a complicated part of the overall system modelling. Specifically, in the case of interclouds and inter-enterprises scheduling optimization is fundamentally important for achieving the best possible capacity in terms of resource utilization. Thus, existing approaches that consider system dynamics, interoperability and heterogeneity issues become important aspects for providing advanced scheduling decisions. In this work, we survey some highly dynamic meta-schedulers that are suitable for enterprises using grids and/or clouds.

This service will show significant cost savings in reducing the human effort for integration, test and execution by providing a powerful interface to combine new and existing configurable event elements and eliminating the time needed to manually configure and execute new sets of applications. The immediate cost savings are only a fraction of the value provided by this platform as a service with future value obtained from repeatable and accurate executions, the ability to mature the platform over time and by the direct linkage of the event purpose and the data collected within the cloud executions.},

We have investigated common practices on service oriented architectures design and knowledge engineering to support the composition of services in the cloud. Research results about information sharing and information modeling by using semantic annotations are discussed. Particularly we present how we use ontological models to represent management information and service lifecycle operations and thus control both system management operations and services running onto cloud infrastructure. We support the idea of look information sharing as a mechanism to facilitate the composition of services, thus ontology-based information modelling is used for this purpose. It enables information exchange by using interoperable data framework for different applications running on infrastructure and application layers. Ontologies support this information sharing approach by formalizing the necessary data needs to be shared or exchanged. An introductory application scenario is depicted. We discuss what implications this approach imposes on architectural design terms and also how virtual infrastructures and cloud-based systems can benefit from this ontological modelling approach.},

abstract={After receiving cancer treatment, patients often experience a decline of HRQoL (health-related quality of life). Physicians typically evaluate HRQoL during periodic clinical visits. However, out-patient reporting of vital signals between two visits could be used to interpret the decline of HRQoL. Considering that the vast majority of patients recovering from cancer are not in hospitals, it is often impractical for the care providers to collect these data. In this paper, we design and prototype caREMOTE, a cancer reporting and monitoring telemedicine system, which can be used in domestic cancer care. By extending a standard clinical trial informatics model, we build a prototype on cloud computing services that can be accessed by a mobile application. We aim to maximize the potential of caREMOTE to help medical practitioners efficiently monitor discharged patients' HRQoL and vital signals, and facilitate data reusability and system interoperability in future collaborative cancer research.},

abstract={With the increasing use of Joint Live Virtual Constructive (JLVC) simulations, tightly-coupled simulations in JLVC environments continue to require considerable effort and resources to integrate federates into new versions of a Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) or High Level Architecture (HLA). The JCWC Team created an innovative "way ahead" for a Next Generation M&S Architecture paradigm to meet this challenge. This paradigm shift leverages benefits from Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs), cloud computing, intelligent agents, composable services and other forward-thinking next generation technologies. Combined, these technologies create acceptable and usable hybrid architectures to reduce JLVC resource requirements while increasing efficiency. A next generation M&S architecture standard is designed to resolve problems associated with tightly-coupled simulations within a federation, i.e. inflexibilities associated with change. Achieving a more efficient, loosely-coupled platform for future JLVC simulations will provide significant cost savings, increased capabilities and greater efficiency, particularly with legacy HLA and RTI upgrades. This paper presents a three-phased plan to support implementation for a planned JLVC environment evolution. The cornerstone of Phase 1 is a cloud-based SOA web service. In this phase, a hybrid SOA infrastructure will leverage and extend an HLA-evolved framework. The hybrid SOA infrastructure will decouple the RTI functionality into common services available to all federates. Phase 2 will deliver decomposed models resulting in composable operational M&S services. Phase 3 will use next generation technology to employ intelligent agents, metadata and model bases to allow "on-the-fly" M&S solution development. Phase 3 will integrate technologies and capabilities not yet used by the DOD, but necessary to continually develop joint adaptive training environment-centric state-ofthe-art solutions. A hybrid SOA M&S solution is the fundamental building block of the Next Generation M&S Architecture and is a key to transforming the JLVC and synthetic environment.},

abstract={Cloud computing faces two business-related issues. First, the management of clouds requires not only technical skills but also the understanding of the business side of these systems. Traditional distributed systems research did not require this understanding, simply assuming that all components involved are willing to cooperate according to the resource allocation algorithm prescribed. This cooperation assumption is not valid anymore if clouds are commercial. Secondly, the demand of cloud customers can cause demand spikes at any time, raising the questions on how to allocate the limited resources. Consequently, a real-time view of the provider's business with respect to revenue streams and costs becomes essential for cloud providers. Such a system helps them to respond in an economically efficient way. From the user perspective, the understanding of the different offerings of clouds is also becoming none-trivial, requiring a support in selecting the best-fitting cloud service. A solution to these two issues is the use of business economics. The objective of this work is to lay out a concept and design of a business support service platform, which is called Cloud Management Cockpit (CMC), which uses business economics for giving decision support to providers for managing clouds and for using clouds. The applications of the CMC are laid out in three scenarios. They highlight the usefulness of the CMC business support models and demonstrate how CMC enables platform interoperability, service composition, and reduces complexity of clouds. © 2011 AICIT.},

abstract={The interoperability of Web services has resulted in its adoption for recently-emerging cloud platforms. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is considered as the main platform independent communication tool for the Cloud Web service. Generally, Cloud Web services suffer performance bottlenecks and congestions that are mainly caused by the encoding of XML messages as they are bigger than the real payloads. In this paper, Fractal clustering model is proposed to compute the Fractal clustering similarity of SOAP messages in order to cluster them and enable the aggregation of SOAP messages to significantly reduce the size of the aggregated SOAP messages. Furthermore, as Fractal is a well-known as a time-consuming technique especially for large dataset, two fast Fractal clustering models have been proposed that are aiming to reduce the required clustering time. The proposed fast Fractal models have tremendously outperformed the classical Fractal model in terms of the processing time and have outperformed both K-means and PCA combined with K-means models in terms of both the processing time and SOAP messages size reduction. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Current cloud-based service offerings are often provided as one-size-fits-all solutions and give little or no room for customization. This limits the ability for application developers to pick and choose offerings from multiple software, platform, infrastructure service providers and configure them dynamically and in an optimal fashion to address their application requirements. Furthermore, combining different independent cloud-based services necessitates a uniform description format that facilitates their design, customization, and composition. Hence, there is a need to break down the monolithic offerings into loosely-coupled cloud services offered by multiple providers that can be flexibly customized and (re-)composed in different settings. We propose in this paper the Blueprint concept - a uniform abstract description for cloud service offerings that may cross different cloud computing layers, i.e. software, platform and infrastructure. Using the proposed Blueprint Template for engineering cloud service offerings will solve these shortcomings and subsequently lower the barrier to entry for cloud computing. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Integrating a database query language into a programming language is becoming increasingly important in recently emerging high-level cloud computing and other applications, where efficient and sophisticated data manipulation is required during computation. This paper reports on seamless integration of SQL into SML# - an extension of Standard ML. In the integrated language, the type system always infers a principal type for any type consistent SQL expression. This makes SQL queries first-class citizens, which can be freely combined with any other language constructs definable in Standard ML. For a program involving SQL queries, the compiler separates SQL queries and delegates their evaluation to a database server, e.g. PostgreSQL or MySQL in the currently implemented version. The type system of our language is largely based on Machiavelli, which demonstrates that ML with record polymorphism can represent type structure of SQL. In order to develop a practical language, however, a number of technical challenges have to be overcome, including static enforcement of server connection consistency, proper treatment of overloaded SQL primitives, query compilation, and runtime connection management. This paper describes the necessary extensions to the type system and compilation, and reports on the details of its implementation. Copyright © 2011 ACM.},

Its contain power generations, transmission network and user automation. It characterized by two way flow of electricity and information to create an automated distributed energy delivery system. From the viewing side of information flow, there are management and protection of the system that must be strategized to ensure the effective operation of the energy delivery system. This cyber security strategy will examine both domain-specific and common requirement to ensure interoperability of solution across different part of infrastructure. This strategy will require risk management framework developed by both private and public sector. This framework will establish the processes for combining impact, vulnerability, and threat information to produce an assessment of risk to the distributed energy delivery system. The approach of this risk management will consider an organizational perspective, cyber security requirement, standard security system, and electricity security guideline and protection plan. This risk management will be applied on an asset, system, and network basis, as applicable. Some security architecture such as key management, virtualization security within cloud computing, and smart privacy will be linked to the energy delivery system. The final strategy of this effort will be a set of recommended cyber security requirements that will be allocated to interfaces of the Smart Grid. The goal is to ensure that a comprehensive assessment of the systems and component of the distributed energy delivery system is completed. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing as a service on demand architecture has become a topic of interest in the last few years. The outsourcing of duties and infrastructure to external parties enables new services to be established quickly, scaled on demand, and with low financial risk. Cloud storage enables organizations to manage their data with low operational expenses. Nevertheless, several issues such as security and the risk to become dependent on a provider for its service should be considered before entering the cloud. In general, a switch of a storage provider is associated with high costs of adapting new APIs and additional charges for inbound and outbound bandwidth and requests. In this paper we use the principle of RAID-technology in cloud infrastructure to manage data distribution across cloud storage providers. The distribution is based on users expectations regarding providers geographic location, quality of service, providers reputation, and budget preferences. Our approach allows users to avoid vendor lock-in, reduce cost of switching providers and increase security and availability of their data. We also explain on how the proposed system removes the complexity of interacting with multiple storage providers while maintaining security. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Cloud computing poses several new security and privacy challenges, mainly related to resource sharing, interoperability and dinamicity among different providers. Although policy specification languages address some of these challenges, many issues still have to be faced with. Policy matching is today performed by way of syntactical approaches, which may limit the selection of suitable services on the one hand, and the flexibility and the dinamicity of the matching process on the other one. In this work we propose a semantic approach that, by means of semantic annotations to WS-Policy documents, allows for an improved matching of security requirements and capabilities based on their actual meaning. The proposed approach has been validated through a case study that shows how a pure syntactic-based mechanism of WS-Policy would have failed in matching two actually compatible policies. © 2011 IEEE.},

In the method, domain ontology is utilized to annotate the types of inputs and outputs of a Web service. Templates are generated and stored according to each type described in the ontology.

The aim of this study is to develop and present an innovative decision-support system and cloud computing software methodology that brings together energy consultants, consumers, energy services procedures and modern web interoperable technologies. The authors propose a web-based knowledge system, using distributed cloud architecture and metering grids over ADSL broadband connections. By using some clustering algorithms and a web middleware, energy profiles over time are analysed and observed. The resulting clusters and centroids are projected and statistically analysed over time, producing a centroid-locus. Hypercube topology was used for efficient data management and software agent-based parallel analysis. The system operates efficiently on a multi-tier cloud-based middleware that generates in real-time using various service software components to the end consumers. The case study on real Greek energy measurements, for the first time in Greece, indicated a compact and efficient distributed procedure that could analyse and produce adaptive personalised information services. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={Cost and scalability benefits of Cloud storage services are apparent. However, selecting a single storage service provider limits availability and scalability to the selected provider and may further cause a vendor lock-in effect. In this paper, we present MetaStorage, a federated Cloud storage system that can integrate diverse Cloud storage providers. MetaStorage is a highly available and scalable distributed hashtable that replicates data on top of diverse storage services. MetaStorage reuses mechanisms from Amazon's Dynamo for cross-provider replication and hence introduces a novel approach to manage consistency-latency tradeoffs by extending the traditional quorum (N, R, W) configurations to an (NP, R, W) scheme that includes different providers as an additional dimension. With MetaStorage, new means to control consistency-latency tradeoffs are introduced. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={A formal catalog representation of Cloud services is required for automated fulfillment of user requests on catalog items, sharing of building blocks across service offerings and semantic interoperability between IT platforms. The technologies and tools provided by the Semantic Web community are well suited to achieve this formal representation. In this paper, we give an analysis on the commonality and differences of typical Cloud service offerings and of their catalog actions' mappings to delivery operations. We introduce a new ontological representation that leverages Semantic Web technology to formally model the structure and relationships of these service offerings and their operational processes. Our algorithm to select and order the execution of appropriate delivery operations uses this representation together with a new notion of safe sequences. This algorithm realizes the catalog action requests while ensuring system robustness by following sequencing rules we developed to prevent failures during the fulfillment processes for complex offerings. We evaluate our model on concrete Cloud offerings. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The amount of medical images has increased significantly over the last decade as result of the increase of number and quality of studies. Following some researchers, this trend will continue over the next years. Cloud computing is a new concept based on a well-know model named "pay-as-you-go". There is a new concept dubbed PACS Cloud, which the fundamental idea is to do PACS outsourcing taking advantages of the clouds elasticity and scalability, avoiding hardware obsolescence, providing universal access to the information anywhere, anytime and increase the data availability. This paper presents a module of PACS Cloud architecture to grant interoperability with DICOM devices. PACS Cloud Gateway is a component of PACS Cloud, which focuses mainly on the translation from DICOM commands to non-DICOM and vice-versa. While data outsource to the cloud can relieve users from the burden of local storage and maintenance, it also brings new security concerns. This paper presents a secure PACS Cloud Gateway to access PACS Cloud archive, which provides a high security level and without cloud's provider dependence. The workflows of each process was described carefully, specifying data flows since that Gateway is contacted by DICOM device, until it releases the process. Finally, the platform was instantiated in biggest Internet Cloud providers and the solution's results was analysed. © 2011 AISTI.},

abstract={Integrating a database query language into a programming language is becoming increasingly important in recently emerging high-level cloud computing and other applications, where efficient and sophisticated data manipulation is required during computation. This paper reports on seamless integration of SQL into SML# - an extension of Standard ML. In the integrated language, the type system always infers a principal type for any type consistent SQL expression. This makes SQL queries first-class citizens, which can be freely combined with any other language constructs definable in Standard ML. For a program involving SQL queries, the compiler separates SQL queries and delegates their evaluation to a database server, e.g. PostgreSQL or MySQL in the currently implemented version. The type system of our language is largely based on Machiavelli, which demonstrates that ML with record polymorphism can represent type structure of SQL. In order to develop a practical language, however, a number of technical challenges have to be overcome, including static enforcement of server connection consistency, proper treatment of overloaded SQL primitives, query compilation, and runtime connection management. This paper describes the necessary extensions to the type system and compilation, and reports on the details of its implementation. Copyright © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Infrastructure federation is becoming an increasingly important issue for modern Distributed Computing Infrastructures (DCIs): Dynamic elasticity of quasi-static Grid environments, incorporation of special-purpose resources into commoditized Cloud infrastructures, cross-community collaboration for increasingly diverging areas of modern e-Science, and Cloud Bursting pose major challenges on the technical level for many resource and middleware providers. Especially with respect to increasing costs of operating data centers, the intelligent yet automated and secure sharing of resources is a key factor for success. With the D-Grid Scheduler Interoperability (DGSI) project within the German D-Grid Initiative, we provide a strategic technology for the automatically negotiated, SLA-secured, dynamically provisioned federation of resources and services for Grid-and Cloud-type infrastructures. This goal is achieved by complementing current DCI schedulers with the ability to federate infrastructure for the temporary leasing of resources and rechanneling of workloads. In this work, we describe the overall architecture and SLA-secured negotiation protocols within DGSI and depict an advanced mechanism for resource delegation through means of dynamically provisioned, virtualized middleware. Through this methodology, we provide the technological foundation for intelligent capacity planning and workload management in a cross-infrastructure fashion. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The future of the education system will restructure through information communication technology (ICT), which is a comprehensive approach to innovate education systems, methods, and management. The new paradigm of ICT in educations is smart services, which enhances the education efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity. The education smart services in Thailand, called NEdNet (National Education Network), are integrated systems including network infrastructure services, education information services (EIS), and Learning services, which facilitator of higher-order thinking skills, support learner-centered, self-directed learning, tailored learning and decision supporting. The first part of NEdNet is network infrastructure systems. Ministry of Education proposed National Education Network (NEdNet) project to develop national education network and provide enough bandwidth for all levels of education. NEdNet is the integration of UniNet Network [6] for higher education, MOENet for schools and VECNet for vocational institutes. NEdNet supports usage of the entire education system with the following bandwidth 1) 293 university connected by dark fiber, which will have bandwidth 1-10 Gbps, 2) 415 vocational institutions, which will have bandwidth 100-1,000 Mbps, and finally 3,000 schools, which will have bandwidth 10-100 Mbps. NEdNet also investigates the coming technology such as 3G, WiMax and FTTx for last mile access networks. NEdNet provides either community internet or research education network (REN), which connected to Internet2 in USA., JGN2 in Japan, TEIN (Trans Eurasia Information Network) and APAN (Asia Pacific Advanced Network). The second part of the NEdNet is education information services (EIS) using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) infrastructure, which provides information for management and executives in three levels. The first level is national level, which establishes a comprehensive e-government project using TH e-Gif (Thailand e-Government Interoperability Framework) [1] to enhance efficiency and quality of general services such as procurement, service delivery, monitoring and evaluation and etc. The second is local level, which shares data and information among education administration organizations and other government departments. The last is school level, which handles education administration in a more efficient, convenient, and innovative way. The last part of NEdNet is Learning services, which provides cloud computing facilities for cyber learning system, digital library (ThaiLis) and educational broadcasting services called E-TV and Teacher TV (IP-TV). These services provide education resources for economically and geographically disadvantaged students and Thailand Cyber University (TCU) for adults to promote lifelong learning. in conclusion, NEdNet is the education smart services, which can contribute to learning outcomes of traditional curriculum domains and can play a greater role in the future education. The network infrastructure decreases students digital-divided in Internet and research networks. The other services are more relevant to quality of education resources, extending learning beyond classrooms, student-centered learning and national competitiveness. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing, a more recent computing paradigm, has evolved from a variety of legacy technologies that include Service oriented Architecture (SOA) and Web services besides several others. The software services in a cloud must be developed based on the service-oriented approach, in order to derive their full potential and benefits. Since, SOA inherently nurtures interoperability; it will enhance the integration and interaction among the cloud software services. Also, leveraging the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach to develop individual cloud software services will result in services that are more robust, flexible and agile in the wake of ever changing technologies.

abstract={User-generated content (UGC) has become one of the dominant media formats. However, current approach to distribute UGC adds two middlemen (e.g., content aggregator and content distributor) in the value chain, resulting in a higher cost for media consumers. We have proposed a new model for content providers to request content-distribution-as-a-service (CoDaaS) in an on-demand fashion from service providers, thus bypassing the middlemen and reducing the total cost of content distribution. In this paper, we extend the concept of CoDaaS over different flavors of future Internet architecture. One challenge to provide such an emerging service over different Internet architecture is to design an intercloud messaging protocol to provide interoperability among all participant network clouds. To tackle this challenge, we structure the inter-cloud messaging protocol into three components including message vehicle, message format and message content. In particular, we highlight a few options for message vehicle and formats and offer our initial choice with rationale; we also categorize message contents into six sub-domains. This structural approach would make our work toward a proof-of-concept system easier. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Cloud computing is changing the way applications are being developed, deployed and managed. Application developers can focus on business and functionality and leverage infrastructure clouds (IaaS) to provide them low cost resources (e.g., computation, storage, and networking) that can be controlled based on application needs. However, current IaaS cloud developers have to deal with daunting tasks to configure and deploy their applications in different cloud providers. This paper presents the Uni4Cloud approach that facilitates to model, deploy and configure complex applications in multiple infrastructure clouds. We demonstrate through an enterprise application case study how Uni4Cloud facilitates to deploy components (e.g., application server, database, load balancer) in multiple clouds using a model-based approach that helps to automatically configure and deploy applications independent of IaaS cloud provider. Moreover, the approach is based on cloud computing standards such as the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) and Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) to favor interoperability and to avoid being locked in to specific cloud providers. © 2011 ACM.},

One of the fundamental challenges in geographically distributed clouds is to provide efficient algorithms for supporting intercloud data management and dissemination. In this paper, we present Plume, a generic distributed intercloud overlay for time-critical event dissemination services. Plume aims at improving the interoperability of interclouds in time-critical event dissemination services, such as computing policy updating, message sharing, event notifications and so forth. Plume organizes these distributed clouds into a novel quorum ring overlay to support a constant event dissemination latency. Our numerical results show that the proposed Plume greatly improves the efficiency as compared to a DHT-based overlay approach and provides better scalability than the fully-meshed approach. © 2011 IEEE.},

There are also limits to the requirements and coverage of these laws, and issues about the definition of accessibility as technology develops. Copyright and digital rights are potentially implicated by cloud-based AT, as well as privacy and security rights. The needed infrastructure and interoperability of cloud based AT may raise concerns for technology developers that regulation may stifle innovation or reduce commercial viability. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

We show how the use of blueprints that were successful on the Web can help to make the adoption of these standards less complex. We discuss in particular how Cloud Computing, RESTful interfaces, Real-time Web (Websockets and Comet) and Web 2.0 Mashups can simplify application development, deployments and maintenance in a common RFID application.

abstract={The recent increase in popularity of Storage-as-a-Service cloud solutions inuences the way scientists are managing their data. More and more academic groups store and work on their data outside the university domain. Hence, data aggregation and metadata management is becoming increas-ingly important. While most cloud storage systems offer convenient access APIs, they are rarely fully compatible with each other. This makes migration between backends, or integration of data located in various places, more complicated. A common an-swer to this vendor lock-in problem lies in adopting common standards. Although there are no commonly adopted standards for cloud storage, yet, the potentially most promising direction at the moment is SNIA's Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI), which defines the semantics of handling data objects and the required metadata. In this paper we present our prototype implementation of CDMI-compatible proxy, which offers a transparent integration layer on top of both cloud systems and local storage infrastructures. The work is being conducted as part of the FP7 project VENUS-C and released under an open-source license. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={In today's highly dynamic economy, businesses have to adapt quickly to market changes, be it customer, competition- or regulation-driven. Cloud computing promises to be a solution to the ever changing computing demand of businesses. Current SaaS, PaaS and IaaS services are often found to be too inflexible to meet the diverse customer requirements regarding service composition and Quality-of-Service. We therefore propose an ontology-based optimization framework allowing Cloud providers to find the best suiting resource composition based on an abstract request for a custom service. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we describe an OWL/SWRL based ontology framework for describing resources (hard- and software) along with their dependencies, interoperability constraints and meta information. Second, we provide an algorithm that makes use of some reasoning queries to derive a graph over all feasible resource compositions based on the abstract request. Third, we show how the graph can be transformed into an integer program, allowing to find the optimal solution from a profit maximizing perspective. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Many rely now on public cloud infrastructure-as-a-service for database servers, mainly, by pushing the limits of existing pooling and replication software to operate large shared-nothing virtual server clusters. Yet, it is unclear whether this is still the best architectural choice, namely, when cloud infrastructure provides seamless virtual shared storage and bills clients on actual disk usage. This paper addresses this challenge with Resilient Asynchronous Commit (RAsC), an improvement to a well-known shared-nothing design based on the assumption that a much larger number of servers is required for scale than for resilience. Then we compare this proposal to other database server architectures using an analytical model focused on peak throughput and conclude that it provides the best performance/cost trade-off while at the same time addressing a wide range of fault scenarios. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

The model produces camera position, camera attitude, and synthetic camera data that can be used for exploitation purposes. We focus on electro-optical (EO) visible sensors to simplify the rendering but this work could be extended to use other rendering tools that support different modalities. Due to the computational complexity of ray tracing we employ the Amazon Elastic Cloud Computer to help speed up the generation of large ray traced scenes. The key idea of the paper is to provide an architecture for layered sensing simulation which is modular in design and constructed on open-source off-the-shelf software. This architecture shows how leveraging existing open-source software allows for practical layered sensing modeling to be rapidly assimilated and utilized in real-world applications. In this paper we demonstrate our model output is automatically exploitable by using generated data with an innovative video frame mosaic algorithm. © 2011 SPIE.},

Increasing numbers of users are migrating their applications to the computing Clouds to remove or reduce the costs on resource investment and management. However, individual Cloud platforms, either private or public, provide their own interfaces for customers to interact with the underlying infrastructures. This situation undoubtedly burdens the users who compute on different Clouds. In this work, we developed a generic interface that allows the user to access the diverse Clouds in a unified way. It provides utilities for requesting and invoking the services. It offers graphical views to show the Cloud information that is visible to the users. The interface also combines different Clouds into a single platform enabling inter-Cloud communications. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to achieve the goal of knowledge sharing and reusing interactively, lots of available e-Learning standards have been adapted to complete this purpose. Normally, learning objects meeting these standards are sharable with other e-Learning platforms. Most e-Learning platforms, however, are unable to share learning objects directly on the Internet. The characteristics of Cloud computing provide a promising infrastructure to compute and store resources as services. Hence, this paper introduces Cloud computing into an e-Learning platform to allow the integration of different e-Learning standards to enhance interoperability of learning objects.

abstract={Complex distributed computing platforms, like cluster systems, grids or clouds, are today's choice to deploy modern applications. With the proliferation of different devices, most of them in the mobile area and the wide support of web social networks, a wider range of applications are executed through a browser, the software components that are currently present in all of the users' devices. Moreover, since the shift of application development from native applications to web applications, modern applications now require complex features in term of supported platforms and development standards to guarantee the applications' interoperability. Distributed architectures such as cloud computing and web standards seem to be the candidates, but there are some issues related to their real applicability, especially when considering an open environment and the languages adopted. Working in a research institute, our focus is on an open platform and adherence to standards since only common standards could guarantee interoperability solutions and real culture diffusion. This paper discusses our approach in searching for suitable platforms and standards to develop applications for several scientific fields: from astronomical applications that are based on web user interfaces querying on distributed databases and producing output in different formats, to communication and outreach fields where the web is the natural platform to disseminate information.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and implements the prototype of an intelligent data processing framework in ubiquitous sensor networks. Much focus is put on how to handle the sensor data stream as well as the interoperability between the low-level sensor data and application clients. Our framework first addresses systematic middleware which mitigates the interaction between the application layer and low-level sensors, for the sake of analyzing a great volume of sensor data by filtering and integrating to create value-added context information. Then, an agent-based architecture is proposed for real-time data distribution to efficiently forward a specific event to the appropriate application registered in the directory service via the open interface. The prototype implementation demonstrates that our framework can host a sophisticated application on the ubiquitous sensor network and it can autonomously evolve to new middleware, taking advantages of promising technologies such as software agents, XML, cloud computing, and the like.},

abstract={The Distributed Infrastructure with Remote Agent Control (DIRAC) software framework allows a user community to manage computing activities in a distributed environment. DIRAC has been developed within the Large Hadron Collider Beauty (LHCb) collaboration. After successful usage over several years, it is the final solution adopted by the experiment. The Belle experiment at the Japanese High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) has the purpose of studying matter/anti-matter asymmetries using B mesons. During its lifetime, Belle detector has collected about 5,000 terabytes of real and simulated data. The analysis of this data requires an enormous amount of computing intensive Monte Carlo simulation. The Belle II experiment, which recently published its technical design report, will produce 50 times more data. Therefore it is interested to determine if commercial computing clouds can reduce the total cost of the experiment's computing solution. This paper describes the setup prepared to evaluate the performance and cost of this approach using real 2010 simulation tasks of the Belle experiment. The setup has been developed using DIRAC as the overall management tool to control both the tasks to be executed and the deployment of virtual machines using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud as service provider. At the same time, DIRAC is also used to monitor the execution, collect the necessary statistical data, and finally upload the results of the simulation to Belle resources on the Grid. The results of a first test using over 2000 days of cpu time show that over 90% efficiency in the use of the resources can easily be achieved. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The Obama Administration is changing the way business is done in Washington and bringing a new sense of responsibility to how we manage taxpayer dollars. We are working to bring the spirit of American innovation and the power of technology to improve performance and lower the cost of government operations. The United States Government is the world's largest consumer of information technology, spending over $76 billion annually on more than 10,000 different systems. Fragmentation of systems, poor project execution, and the drag of legacy technology in the Federal Government have presented barriers to achieving the productivity and performance gains found when technology is deployed effectively in the private sectors. In September 2009, we announced the Federal Government's Cloud Computing Initiative. Cloud computing has the potential to greatly reduce waste, increase data center efficiency and utilization rates, and lower operating costs. This chapter presents an overview of cloud computing across the public sector. It provides the Federal Government's definition of cloud computing, and includes details on deployment models, service models, and common characteristics of cloud computing. As we move to the cloud, we must be vigilant in our efforts to ensure that the standards are in place for a cloud computing environment that provides for security of government information, protects the privacy of our citizens, and safeguards our national security interests. This chapter provides details regarding the National Institute of Standards and Technology's efforts to facilitate and lead the development of standards for security, interoperability, and portability. Furthermore, this chapter details Federal budget guidance issued to agencies to foster the adoption of cloud computing technologies, where relevant, and provides an overview of the Federal Government's approach to data center consolidation. This chapter concludes with 30 illustrative case studies at the Federal, state and local government levels. These case studies reflect the growing movement across the public sector to leverage cloud computing technologies. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cloud computing has become one of the key considerations both in academia and industry. Cheap, seemingly unlimited computing resources that can be allocated almost instantaneously and pay-as-you-go pricing schemes are some of the reasons for the success of Cloud computing. The Cloud computing landscape, however, is plagued by many issues hindering adoption. One such issue is vendor lock-in, forcing the Cloud users to adhere to one service provider in terms of data and application logic. Semantic Web has been an important research area that has seen significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers. One key property of Semantic Web is the notion of interoperability and portability through high level models. Significant work has been done in the areas of data modeling, matching, and transformations. The issues the Cloud computing community is facing now with respect to portability of data and application logic are exactly the same issue the Semantic Web community has been trying to address for some time. In this paper we present an outline of the use of well established semantic technologies to overcome the vendor lock-in issues in Cloud computing. We present a semantics-centric programming paradigm to create portable Cloud applications and discuss MobiCloud, our early attempt to implement the proposed approach. © 2010 IEEE.},

Although the service is useful, there are 3 problems about latency problem, non-availability problem and privacy problem for users due to vendor lock-in. The followings are 3 main purposes of this paper. First, MyCIoud become faster than well-known cloud storage services in data-download speed. Second, users can control availability. Third, privacy is preserved against anybody included cloud vendors. MyCIoud constructs secret sharing storage system using some vendors' cloud storages in parallel. User data is not saved on cloud storages directly. The data is encrypted and redundantly distributed over several vendors' cloud storages. MyCIoud downloads all divided data from selected high-performance cloud nodes which has stored target data. First, MyCIoud downloads data 13 times faster than the well-known cloud storage. Second, MyCIoud is fault tolerant system against disaster of cloud storages. User can control the tradeoff between availability and cost to operate redundancy. Third, MyCIoud preserves user's privacy against cloud vendors and anybody to encrypt and distribute user's data.},

abstract={The last decade has been a substantial increase in commodity desktop and distributed Geographic Information System applications with client-server or browser-server architectures, mainly as a result of faster hardware and network performance. Nevertheless, there are still problems, in the field of GIS applications, which can not be effectively cooperative used due to the complicated geospatial data formats and geographically distributed resources. The new approach of Utilities computing known by several names, such as Cloud computing, Grid computing or cluster computing is a new trend. As a data intensive application, GIS can benefit from Cloud computing to solve the application interoperability bottleneck. Hence, in this paper, we analyze the weakness and problems of traditional GIS, and then give the approach to solve those problems by Cloud computing and web services. This paper presents the architecture of Geospatial Data Service within Cloud computing environment and its relative technology. In conclusion, this paper provides a solution of execution model based on GML and Web Services. At last, we discuss its implementation process based on Intranet. ©2010 IEEE.},

This paper reviews this novel technology and identifies the paradigm behind it with regard to SDIs. Concepts of SDIs are analyzed in respect to common gaps which can be solved by Cloud Computing technologies. A real world use case will be presented, which benefits largely from Cloud Computing as a proof-of-concept demonstration. This use case shows that SDI components can be integrated into the cloud as value-added services. Thereby SDI components are shifted from a Software as a Service cloud layer to the Platform as a Service cloud layer, which can be regarded as a future direction for SDIs to enable geospatial cloud interoperability. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

To guarantee a common usage of the data within various applications, several RDF stores providing data management services have been developed. Here, we represent a systematic approach to solve a late latency problem of data loading of the stores. It enables a fast loading performance for very large size of RDF data, and it is proven with an existing RDF store. This approach employs a cloud computing service and delegates preparation works to the machines which are temporarily borrowed at little payment. Our implementation for a native version of the Sesame RDF Repository was tested on LUBM 1000 University data (138 million triples), and it showed a local store loading time of 16.2 minutes with additional preparation time on a cloud service taking approximately an hour, which can be reduced by adding supplemental machines to the cluster.},

abstract={eGovernance has made rapid progress in the last decade. Today thousands of eGovernment systems are operational which provide a large variety of G2C, G2B and G2G services. With the rising maturity and complexity, the stakeholders have begun to realise the need for developing interoperable and reusable systems. The interoperability and reusability enables rapid scalability in terms of both functionality and reach. However, this is not possible if the eGovernment systems are designed and developed independently by different government agencies and departments, where the focus is only on achieving the agency / departmental objectives. With this realisation many Governments have adopted the Enterprise Architecture approach. The IEEE standard 1471 defines Enterprise Architecture as "fundamental conception of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, their relationships to each other and to its environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution", and architecture framework as "set of common practices for architectural description established within a specific domain or stakeholder community". Various Governments and Government agencies have created architecture frameworks for use within their domain. Some examples are European Interoperability Framework (EIF), Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) of USA etc. The Governments around the world are rapidly following these leads and building their own frameworks. The Government of India has constituted expert groups for building an interoperability framework as well as FEAF for eGovernance in India. While these developments are going on, a paradigm shift in the form of cloud computing appears to be taking shape. With the advent of cloud computing, and large scale support it is getting from the technology vendors, it is inevitable that before long, eGovernance architects will have to deal with cloud computing. A lot of literature has been generated with arguments for and against cloud computing. In this paper we first look at cloud computing from the architecture perspective. We have raised the issue of whether cloud should be viewed as just the infrastructure layer of an enterprise architecture (based on the four layer EA model of TOGAF), or should it be viewed as the environment in which eGovernance systems operate, or both. We have then tried to categorise the issues about cloud computing based on how it is viewed architecturally. Then we look at some of these issues and challenges which will be more relevant to eGovernance architecture. We feel that once an architect has this clarity, he / she will be better equipped to make most optimal architectural decisions for the eGovernance system under construction.},

abstract={Recently, a number of cloud platforms and services have been developed for data intensive computing, including Hadoop, Sector, CloudStore (formerly KFS), HBase, and Thrift. In order to benchmark the performance of these systems, to investigate their interoperability, and to experiment with new services based on flexible compute node and network provisioning capabilities, we have designed and implemented a large scale testbed called the Open Cloud Testbed (OCT). Currently OCT has 120 nodes in 4 data centers: Baltimore, Chicago (two locations), and San Diego. In contrast to other cloud testbeds, which are in small geographic areas and which are based on commodity Internet services, the OCT is a wide area testbed and the 4 data centers are connected with a high performance 10Gb/s network, based on a foundation of dedicated lightpaths. This testbed can address the requirements of extremely large data streams that challenge other types of distributed infrastructure. We have also developed several utilities to support the development of cloud computing systems and services, including novel node and network provisioning services, a monitoring system, and an RPC system. In this paper, we describe the OCT concepts, architecture, infrastructure, a few benchmarks that were developed for this platform, interoperability studies, and results. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2010.},

abstract={To address interoperability and scalability issues for cloud computing, in our previous paper, we presented a novel cloud market model called CACM that enables a dynamic collaboration (DC) platform among different Cloud providers. As the initiator of dynamic collaboration, primary Cloud provider (pCP) needs an efficient local task selection and allocation algorithm to partition the whole tasks and allocate those tasks to be executed locally. Existing task allocation algorithms cannot be directly applicable in a DC environment since they may cause low resource utilization of local resources. So in this paper we propose a general task selection and allocation framework to improve resource utilization for pCP. The framework utilizes an adaptive filter to select tasks and a modified heuristic algorithm to allocate tasks. Moreover, a trade-off metric is developed as the optimization goal of heuristic algorithm, so that it is able to manage and optimize the trade-off between QoS of tasks and utilization of resources. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is the emerging technology in distributed, autonomic, service-oriented, on-demand, trusted computing. The fact that several Cloud solutions have been implemented so far, such as Amazon EC2 and S 3, IBM's Blue Cloud, Sun Network.com, Microsoft Azure Services Platform, etc., is evidence of the great success already achieved by this computing paradigm. On the other hand, an increasing number of research projects focus on Cloud (Nimbus, OpenNEbula, Eucalyptus, OpenQRM, RESERVOIR, etc.) thus confirming that the topic is really hot, attracts investments and funds, and involves more and more researchers. Our idea of Cloud has been synthesized into Cloud@Home, a computing paradigm that supports both open and commercial communities. Starting from the contribution philosophy at the basis of the Volunteer computing paradigm, we imagine a Cloud built on off the shelf, independent, network-connected resources and devices owned and managed by different users. Such users can both sell and/or buy their resources to/from Cloud providers or, alternatively, they can share them with other users establishing open interoperable Clouds. Being aware of the crucial and driving role played by the RESERVOIR project in defining and implementing a reference architecture for Cloud computing, in this paper we focus on how to adapt and use the results of such project in the Cloud@Home specification. Starting from the RESERVOIR architecture, we discuss and detail how the Cloud@Home paradigm can be implemented on top of it, individuating components and modules to be integrated in a new reference architecture which allows to extend RESERVOIR towards the Volunteer contributing paradigm, improving SLA management and federation issues and, at the same time, enhancing virtualization and resources management in Cloud@Home. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2010.},

However, with the emerging of various Grid middlewares, the heterogeneous problem also occurs for Grid middleware themselves, as well as for the Grid services developed on those middlewares, which is an obstacle for the interoperation. SOA(Service Oriented Architecture) has been introduced into the development of Grid middewares and services to solve this problem. One of the challenging tasks in the development, integration and deployment of Grid middlewares is to provide security framework. In this paper, the key issue of Grid security framework, i.e., authorization, is focused, and an attribute-based authorization framework is presented. Due to the adoption of SAML, XACML and the generic Web Service specifications, the proposed framework can achieve interoperability to other standard-based attribute authority services, as well as other standard-based policy evaluation services. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Currently, interoperability and scalability are two major challenging issues for cloud computing. Forming a dynamic collaboration (DC) platform among cloud providers (CPs) can help to better address these issues. A DC platform can facilitate expense reduction, avoiding adverse business impacts and offering collaborative or portable cloud services to consumers. However, there are two major challenges involved in this undertaking; one is to find an appropriate market model to enable a DC platform, and the other one is to minimize conflicts among CPs that may occur in a market-oriented DC platform. In this paper, we present a novel combinatorial auction (CA)-based cloud market (CACM) model that enables a DC platform in CPs. To minimize conflicts among CPs, a new auction policy is proposed that allows a CP to dynamically collaborate with suitable partner CPs to form groups and publishes their group bids as a single bid to compete in the auction. However, identifying a suitable combination of CP partners to form the group and reduce conflicts is a NP-hard problem. Hence, we propose a promising multi-objective (MO) optimization model for partner selection using individual information and past collaborative relationship information, which is seldom considered. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) called MOGA-IC is proposed to solve the MO optimization problem. This algorithm is developed using two popular MOGAs, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and the strength pareto evolutionary genetic algorithm (SPEA2). The experimental results show that MOGA-IC with NSGA-II outperformed the MOGA-IC with SPEA2 in identifying useful pareto-optimal solution sets. Other simulation experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the MOGA-IC in terms of satisfactory partner selection and conflict minimization in the CACM model. In addition, the performance of the CACM model was compared to the existing CA model in terms of economic efficiency. © 2010 Institut Télécom and Springer-Verlag.},

These include CCTV assessment, intrusion detection, radio communications and door control systems. User Interfaces range from colour graphic touch screens to knobs, push buttons etc. Operational and technical challenges include the following issues: - sub-system technology is vendor specific, - reliability is critical in a challenging environment, - system maintenance is expensive, - inconsistent "Look and Feel" resulting in usability issues, - costly to add new systems, multiple, legacy and proprietary protocols & connectivity approaches, legacy installations are cable intensive, - minimal operator or maintenance training crossover, - procurement requirements drive "silo" system implementation. The objective is to develop a "next generation" systems architecture that will: "abstract" the subsystem user management interfaces, ensuring all sub-systems can be managed using a simple, consistent graphical user interface, accessible using a web browser; model the data and behaviour of the edge devices, doors; cameras, sensors, etc. and normalizes it; allowing them to be managed by and provide notifications to standard software based applications; support inter-domain interoperability; use an industry standard communications protocol, likely with extensions, such as BACNet or SNMP, for edge device to application server connectivity; use TCP/IP over fibre as the preferred transport, network and physical technologies; integrate legacy sub-systems into the application server using mediation software; define the look and feel of the graphical icons that represent the edge devices and the physical environment in which they are placed, so that each domain is presented in a consistent manner. Developing and adopting this architecture will allow Correctional Service Canada to address the challenges of its unique environment and support the definition, procurement and deployment of subsystems more effectively. ©2010 Crown.},

abstract={Knowledge discovery is the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful and ultimately understandable patterns in data. The complicated computational environment with ultra-large-scale, heterogeneous, highly-dynamic, and semantic-implicit data in the 21st century puts forward new problems and challenges for traditional knowledge discovery. As a solution, Semantic Web and Cloud Computing addresses the problem of semantic interoperability and large-scale resources sharing, thus making it a proper environment for future's knowledge discovery and data mining. As a probing research, this paper aims to answer the question: "what is knowledge discovery in Semantic era". We discuss the virtual organization of knowledge discovery in Semantic Era, and introduce five roles in this environment. Moreover, we emphasize four distinguishing characteristics of knowledge discovery in Semantic era: 1) the dynamic semantic extension and self-description of algorithm; 2) the semantic integration of heterogeneous data; 3) the enablement of high-level semantic reasoning and knowledge discovery; 4) the circular refinement of knowledge and semantics. Considering the approaching era of Semantic Web and Cloud Computing, the walking towards knowledge discovery in Semantic era could be expected. ©2010 IEEE.},

Trust has proved to be one of the most important and effective alternative means to construct security in distributed systems. In order to efficiently and safely construct entities' trust relationship in cloud and cross-clouds environment, this paper proposed a novel cloud trust model and a new cloud security framework. The propose trust model is domain-based. It divides one cloud provider's resource nodes into the same trust domain. It designs different trust strategies for different roles. Trust recommendation is treated as one type of cloud services just like computation or storage. Based on the proposed trust model, it introduced a novel cloud security framework with an independent trust management module. Using the proposed security model, it introduced some trust-based security mechanisms. Results of simulation experiments show that the proposed security model can achieve high transaction success rate with high trust accuracy. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Working groups have proposed building a layered set of protocols to solve the Cloud Computing interoperability challenge called "Intercloud Protocols". Instead of each cloud provider establishing connectivity with another cloud provider in a Point-to-Point manner resulting in the n2 complexity problem, Intercloud Directories and Exchanges will act as mediators for enabling connectivity and collaboration among disparate cloud providers. Point to Point protocols such as HTTP are not suitable beyond 1-to-1 models, therefore the discussions around many-to-many mechanisms have been proposed, including XMPP. This paper details the use of an XMPP mechanism for such mediation. On top of that, for the federation of the resources themselves, we define a resources catalog approach, using the Semantic Web Resource Definition Framework (RDF) along with a common Ontology of Cloud Computing Resources to work across a variety of heterogeneous cloud providers. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Semantic refinement of stakeholders' requirements is a fundamental issue in requirements engineering. Facing with the on-demand collaboration problem among the heterogeneous, autonomous, and dynamic service resources in the Web, service requirements refinement becomes extremely important, and the key issue in service requirements refinement is semantic interoperability aggregation. A method for creating connecting ontologies driven by requirement sign ontology is proposed. Based on connecting ontologies, a method for semantic interoperability aggregation in requirements refinement is proposed. In addition, we discover that the necessary condition for semantic interoperability is semantic similarity, and the sufficient condition is the coverability of the agreed mediation ontology. Based on this viewpoint, a metric framework for calculating semantic interoperability capability is proposed. This methodology can provide a semantic representation mechanism for refining users' requirements; meanwhile, since users' requirements in the Web usually originate from different domains, it can also provide semantic interoperability guidance for networked service discovery, and is an effective approach for the realization of on-demand service integration. The methodology will be beneficial in service-oriented software engineering and cloud computing. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.},

It also discusses how the distinctive attributes of the PrPl-based digital asset management system can serve as a large-scale robust e-portfolio system that can address issues with scalability, sustainability, adoptability and interoperability. With such a new distinctive design, a large-scale deployment at a state or national level becomes possible at a very cost-effective manner and also such large-scale deployment with intelligent digital asset management and search features create numerous opportunities in education. © 2010 Becta.

abstract={The combination of hardware assisted virtualization and the broadband Internet have taken the Information Technology (IT) hosted managed services to a next level of evolution, where the software applications have become independent of the hardware infrastructure and can be migrated at will. This introduces two key issues that need to be addressed to fully leverage the potential that the new servers and virtualization offer: 1. The operation and management of virtual services have to be decoupled from the operation and management of the server, network and storage physical infrastructure that hosts them 2. Resource provisioning must be application sensitive, dynamic to meet the transient nature of services that can migrate and must accommodate latency constraints of services that utilize them. The second international IEEE Workshop On collaboration & Cloud Computing under the aegis of 19th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE) 2010, is devoted to address the operation and management issues in the next generation cloud computing.

abstract={With a long-run accumulation of IT technologies, cloud computing becomes a new revolution after PC revolution in 1980s, the Internet revolution in 1990s, and the mobile Internet revolution in 2000s. Cloud computing is a paradigm of Internet computing, which takes software as a service oriented to a number of users with changing requirements from time to time, at the same time, takes the response of a requirement as an up-to-date best effort rather than a unique precise one. It is changing the way we share data, information and knowledge. Services support direct reusing of application programs instead of software deployment, and improve usability of resource sharing. Clouds can be regarded as an enabler for interoperation of large scale service provisioning. Therefore, assembling of software became services aggregation under the mature understanding of interoperability. Services interoperation may happen between a user (group) and a service, or among services. Users or their groups, services or their aggregations are all called agents here. The description of interoperability of agents focuses on three issues: their role, goal, and combination of services. The role issue characterizes the organization, roles, and actors of an agent, and describes the interaction and cooperation among them. The goal issue depicts the decomposition of goals and determines the constraint relationship among goals. While the two issues compose the problem domain, the third issue is related to the solution domain, in which process distinguishes atomic processes, and composite processes, and defines the input/output together with precondition/effect of processes respectively, the service guides the construction of service chains and aggregation of resources. Usually, the description in problem domain is qualitative, while the specification in solution domain is quantitative. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The increasing popularity of cloud storage is leading organizations to consider moving data out of their own data centers and into the cloud. However, success for cloud storage providers can present a significant risk to customers; namely, it becomes very expensive to switch storage providers. In this paper, we make a case for applying RAID-like techniques used by disks and file systems, but at the cloud storage level. We argue that striping user data across multiple providers can allow customers to avoid vendor lock-in, reduce the cost of switching providers, and better tolerate provider outages or failures. We introduce RACS, a proxy that transparently spreads the storage load over many providers. We evaluate a prototype of our system and estimate the costs incurred and benefits reaped. Finally, we use trace-driven simulations to demonstrate how RACS can reduce the cost of switching storage vendors for a large organization such as the Internet Archive by seven-fold or more by varying erasure-coding parameters.

abstract={Cloud computing is the "new hot" topic in IT. It combines the maturity of Web technologies (networking, APIs, semantic Web 2.0, languages, protocols and standards such as WSDL, SOAP, REST, WS-BPEL, WS-CDL, IPSEC, etc.), the robustness of geographically distributed computing paradigm (Network, Internet and Grid computing) and self-management capabilities (Autonomic computing), with the capacity to manage quality of services by monitoring, metering, quantifying and billing computing resources and costs (Utility computing). Those have made possible and cost-effective for businesses, small and large, to completely host data- and application-centers virtually... in the Cloud. Our idea of Cloud proposes a new dimension of computing, in which everyone, from single users to communities and enterprises, can, on one hand, share resources and services in a transparent way and, on the other hand, have access to and use such resources and services adaptively to their requirements. Such an enhanced concept of Cloud, enriching the original one with Volunteer computing and interoperability challenges, has been proposed and synthesized in Cloud@Home. The complex infrastructure implementing Cloud@Home has to be supported by an adequate distributed middleware able to manage it. In order to develop such a complex distributed software, in this paper we apply software engineering principles such as rigor, separation of concerns and modularity. Our idea is, starting from a software engineering approach, to identify and separate concerns and tasks, and then to provide both the software middleware architecture and the hardware infrastructure following the hw/sw co-design technique widely used in embedded systems. In this way we want to primarily identify and specify the Cloud@Home middleware architecture and its deployment into a feasible infrastructure; secondly, we want to propose the development process we follow, based on hardware/software co-design, in distributed computing contexts, demonstrating its effectiveness through Cloud@Home. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Even though mainly commercial Cloud solutions have been implemented so far, the Cloud computing approach is quickly and widely spreading in open contexts such as scientific and academic communities. Two main research directions can be identified in such context: to provide an open Cloud infrastructure able to share resources to the community; and to implement an interoperable framework, allowing commercial and open Cloud infrastructures to interact. In this paper we present the Cloud@Home paradigm as an effective solution to the problem of building open and interoperable Clouds. In this new paradigm, users' hosts are not passive interface to Cloud services anymore, but they can interact (for free or by charge) with other Clouds, that therefore must be able to interoperate. © 2010 author/owner(s).},

abstract={The Single European Electronic Market (SEEM) is expected to stimulate the take-up of eBusiness in Europe, increasing the competitiveness of SMEs through advanced eBusiness process models and tools, by offering to companies a model for modernizing work organization that allows them to face changing markets with an effective use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). However, the Building and Construction industry (B&C) has its ICT fragmented, having in the Building Information Model (BIM) paradigm a vehicle to address this problem. Interfacing with BIM brings another layer of complexity, mostly due to the heterogeneity of the systems and applications that need to interface with it. Thus, the adoption of a cluster of proper services in the Web that can offer in a unique way the functionalities needed for the adoption of BIM, is essential. The implementation of BIM under the Cloud Computing paradigm holds the promise of accelerating the B&C industry to achieve the Single Electronic Market. After presenting the vision for a Single European Electronic Market, and the expectation of the B&C sector to be integrated in a universal information space, this paper proposes the SOA4BIM framework as a cloud of services that enables universal access to the BIM paradigm by any system, application, or end user on the web. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={For application providers, cloud computing has the advantage that it reduces the administrative effort required to satisfy processing and storage requirements. However, to simplify the task of building scalable applications, some of the cloud computing platforms impose constraints on the application architecture, its implementation and tools that may be used in development; Microsoft Azure is no exception. In this paper we show how an existing drug discovery system - Discovery Bus - can benefit from Azure even though none of its components was built in the .Net framework. Using an approach based on the "Deployment and Configuration of Component-based Applications Specfication" (D&C), we were able to assemble and deploy jobs that include different types of process-based tasks. We show how extending D&C deployment models with temporal and spatial constraints provided the flexibility needed to move all the compute-intensive tasks within the Discovery Bus to Azure with no changes to their original code. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Cloud interoperability requirements arise due to two types of heterogeneities such as vertical heterogeneity and horizontal heterogeneity. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) clouds offer faster setup for applications, while the free hosting opportunities of some platform cloud providers can be exploited. Semantic models such as ontologies can formalize more details than other traditional modeling techniques and enable reasoning, a way to make inferences and gain new knowledge. Various types of semantics that are useful for porting or interoperability in cloud computing include data, functional, nonfunctional, and system. The language abstraction level indicates the modeling's granularity and specificity and the software lifecycle stage is important in determining the modeling requirements.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel combinatorial auction (CA) based Cloud market model that facilitates dynamic collaboration (DC) among Cloud providers (CPs) for providing composite/collaborative Cloud services to consumers and hence can address the interoperability and scalability issues for Cloud computing. Also to minimize the conflicts that may happen when negotiating among providers in a DC platform, we propose a new auction policy in CA that allows a CP to dynamically collaborate with suitable partner CPs to form a group before joining the auction and to publish their group bids as a single bid to fulfill the service requirements completely. But to find a good combination of CP partners is a NP-hard problem. So we propose a promising multi-objective (MO) optimization model for CP partner selection that not only uses their individual information (INI) but also their past collaborative relationship information (PRI) which is seldom considered in existing approaches. A multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) called MOGA-IC is also developed to solve the model. We implemented our proposed CACM model and the MOGA-IC in a simulated environment and study their economic efficiency and performance with existing model and algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed MOGA-IC can support satisfactory and high quality partner selection in CACM model. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Current cloud computing infrastructure offerings are lacking in interoperability, which is a hindrance to the advancement and adoption of the cloud computing paradigm. As clouds are made interoperable, federations of clouds may be formed. Such federations are from the point of view of the user not burdened by vendor lock-in, and opens for business possibilities where a market place of cloud computing infrastructure can be formed. Federated clouds require unified management interfaces regarding the virtual machines (VMs) that comprise the services running in the cloud federation. Standardization efforts for the required management interfaces have so far focused on definition of description formats regarding VMs, and the control of already deployed VMs. We propose technology-neutral interfaces and architectural additions for handling placement, migration, and monitoring of VMs in federated cloud environments, the latter as an extension of current monitoring architectures used in Grid computing. The interfaces presented adhere to the general requirements of scalability, efficiency, and security in addition to specific requirements related to the particular issues of interoperability and business relationships between competing cloud computing infrastructure providers. In addition, they may be used equally well locally and remotely, creating a layer of abstraction that simplifies management of virtualized service components. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing technologies are changing the way in which services are deployed and operated nowadays, introducing advantages such as a great degree of flexibility (e.g. pay-peruse models, automatic scalability, etc.). However, existing offerings (Amazon EC2, GoGrid, etc.) are based on proprietary service definition mechanisms, thus introducing vendor lock-in to the customers who deploy their services on those clouds. On the other hand, there are open standards that address the problem of packaging and distributing virtual appliances (i.e. complete software stacks deployed in one or more virtual machines), but they have not been designed specifically for clouds. This paper proposes a service specification language for cloud computing platforms, based on the DMTF's Open Virtualization Format standard, extending it to address the specific requirements of these environments. In order to assess the feasibility of our proposal, we have implemented a prototype system able to deploy and scale service specifications using the proposed extensions. Additionally, practical results are presented based on an industrial case study that demonstrates using the software prototype how to automatically deploy and flexibly scale the Sun Grid Engine application.

Once the faculty and staff saw the potential for collaboration the requests to opt-in increased. This allowed collaboration between faculty and students on a scale not previously witnessed at CSU. Faculty who have made the switch to Google Apps are satisfied and enthusiastic with the service. The Google Apps for Education suite comprises Google Mail, Calendar, Talk, Docs, Sites and Video.

abstract={With the development of cloud computing, the mutual understandability among distributed Access Control Policies (ACPs) has become an important issue in the security field of cloud computing. Semantic Web technology provides the solution to semantic interoperability of heterogeneous applications. In this paper, we analysis existing access control methods and present a new Semantic Access Control Policy Language (SACPL) for describing ACPs in cloud computing environment. Access Control Oriented Ontology System (ACOOS) is designed as the semantic basis of SACPL. Ontology-based SACPL language can effectively solve the interoperability issue of distributed ACPs. This study enriches the research that the semantic web technology is applied in the field of security, and provides a new way of thinking of access control in cloud computing. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Trust is one of the most important means to improve security and enable interoperability of current heterogeneous independent cloud platforms. This paper first analyzed several trust models used in large and distributed environment and then introduced a novel cloud trust model to solve security issues in cross-clouds environment in which cloud customer can choose different providers' services and resources in heterogeneous domains can cooperate. The model is domain-based. It divides one cloud provider's resource nodes into the same domain and sets trust agent. It distinguishes two different roles cloud customer and cloud server and designs different strategies for them. In our model, trust recommendation is treated as one type of cloud services just like computation or storage. The model achieves both identity authentication and behavior authentication. The results of emulation experiments show that the proposed model can efficiently and safely construct trust relationship in cross-clouds environment. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Although cloud computing is generally recognized as a technology which will has a significant impact on IT in the future. However, Cloud computing is still in its infancy, currently, there is not a standard available for it, portability and interoperability is also impossible between different Cloud Computing Service Providers, therefore, handicaps the widely deploy and quick development of cloud computing, there is still a long distance to the fine scenery which theoretically depicted by cloud computing. We analyze the problems in the current state of the art, put forward that Open Cloud Computing Federation is an inevitable approach for the widely use of cloud computing and to realize the greatest value of it. Accordingly, we proposal the MABOCCF (Mobile Agent Based Open Cloud Computing Federation) mechanism in this paper, it combines the advantages of Mobile Agent and cloud computing to provide a realization for the Open Cloud Computing Federation, MABOCCF can span over multiple heterogeneous Cloud Computing platforms and realizes portability and interoperability, it can be a beginning of open cloud computing federation and a future part of cloud computing. We also present in this paper the rationalities and the motivations for the combination of Mobile Agent and Cloud Computing, finally, a prototype is given with a performance analysis. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the past few years, Grid computing has become an increasingly hot topic in the world of new technologies. It is gradually also becoming familiar to the mass public through scientific and industrial field trials. Grid computing has been adopted and is used by academia and industry due to its high potential for improving manageability, utilizations, and performance of geographically distributed and diverse resource centers. During 2008 and 2009 commercial interest shifted from "grids" to "clouds", with the availability of several on-demand compute and storage resources. Recently, interest has been growing to integrate grid and cloud computing with the Next Generation Network (NGN) in the telecommunication domain. Telecom operators are bound to become key players in a grid and cloud computing value chain as they provide connectivity and own computing resources. Moreover they have established customer relationships and accounting/billing experience, essential for business/commercial grids and clouds. Defining the best ways to integrate existing as well as future telecommunication equipment and network infrastructure with grids and clouds assumes the availability of interoperable Grid solutions built by IT in conjunction with the Telecom industry. This paper describes the approach taken by ETSI Technical Committee for Grid computing (TC GRID) and STF 331 (ICT GRID Technologies Interoperability and Standardization) to support the integration of grid and cloud computing with the NGN architecture.},

abstract={Server virtualization is one of the hottest trends in industry today. The Department of Defense (DoD) is beginning to make use of the capabilities of this technology. The efficiencies it offers in server consolidation, software licensing and decreased Information Technology (IT) resources are well documented. What are not readily apparent are the benefits it offers from encapsulation of existing systems. Many of the current, in-use simulation systems today are difficult to install, configure, and execute. Server virtualization offers a real alternative to bringing in specifically trained personnel to accomplish these tasks. With server virtualization, you can capture the specific knowledge required for operating system configuration parameters and system start up, codifying the knowledge of the skilled system administrator or software developer. This enables the system to be used when needed by lesser-skilled personnel. Beyond that, using a well defined server virtualization scheme, you also gain real configuration control and repeatability. This paper will briefly inform the audience of current server virtualization technology and a program underway at US Joint Forces Command Joint Warfighting Center that is "virtualizing" the Joint Live Virtual Constructive (JLVC) federation. Server virtualization can and will remove roadblocks for more widespread and economical use of Models and Simulation (M&S) by the DoD. Stretching server virtualization to be a "tailored" cloud, a specifically constructed set of services that can be scheduled on an ad-hoc basis requires connectivity. That connectivity should be as dynamic as possible to enable participating systems to execute properly and exchange network data. Virtual networking will enable that connectivity requirement to be realized. Copyright © (2009) by SISO - Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization.},

abstract={All of the military services are actively seeking improved tools and methods for providing warfighters with improved situation awareness of battlefield conditions. RAM Laboratories is working to emphasize the advantages of moving simulation activities away from big, complex, vertically integrated simulation systems running on dedicated high-powered platforms. We are moving instead towards a new model of service-oriented simulation providing access to modular domain-specific simulation models that fully support dynamic composition and varying patterns of connectivity between multiple light-weight nodes. These distributed simulation capabilities can be readily combined with advanced analysis techniques, including knowledge inferencing and hypothesis testing, within a service-oriented architecture (SOA) framework to provide situation awareness solutions that are robust and resilient to the effects of incomplete and unreliable data sources. The paper discusses the design of a service-oriented simulation software framework as part of a broader approach towards generating improved levels of actionable views of situation awareness; an approach that aligns and scales with current trends towards the increased use of SOA and cloud computing technologies. The paper describes design features that enable powerful and flexible access to distributed simulation capabilities, increased opportunities for software component reuse, and rapid development and deployment of new applications utilizing multiple levels of simulation capabilities.},

abstract={Performance engineering of parallel and distributed applications is a complex task that iterates through various phases, ranging from modeling and prediction, to performance measurement, experiment management, data collection, and bottleneck analysis. There is no evidence so far that all of these phases should/can be integrated in a single monolithic tool. Moreover, the emergence of Cloud computing as well as established Grid infrastructures as a wide-area platform for high-performance computing raises the idea to provide tools as interacting Web services that share resources, support interoperability among different users and tools, and most important provide omni-present services over Grid or Cloud infrastructures. We have developed the ASKALON tool set to support performance-oriented development of parallel and distributed applications. ASKALON comprises four tools, coherently integrated into a Web service-based distributed architecture. SCALEA is a performance instrumentation, measurement, and analysis tool of parallel and distributed applications. ZENTURIO is a general purpose experiment management tool with advanced support for multi-experiment performance analysis and parameter studies. AKSUM provides semi-automatic high-level performance bottleneck detection through a special-purpose performance property specification language. The Grid-Prophet enables the user to model and predict the performance of parallel and distributed applications at early development stages. In this chapter we describe the overall architecture of the ASKALON tool set and outline the basic functionality of the four constituent tools. The structure of each tool is based on the composition and sharing of remote Web services, thus enabling tool interoperability. In addition, a Data Repository allows the tools to share common application performance and output data which has been derived by the individual tools. A Service Repository is used to store common portable Web service implementations. A general-purpose Factory service is employed to create service instances on arbitrary remote computing sites. Discovering and dynamically binding to existing remote services is achieved through a Registry service. The ASKALON visualization diagrams support both online and post-mortem visualization of performance and output data.We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of ASKALON by applying the tools to a variety of real-world applications. © 2009 Springer London.},

abstract={The skyrocketing demand for a new generation of cloud-based consumer and business applications is driving the need for next generation of datacenters that must be massively scalable, efficient, agile, reliable and secure. The authors see a parallel between the state of the datacenters today and the evolution of the Intelligent Network (IN) infrastructure in telecommunication. The telecommunications networks have for many years, demonstrated their ability to reliably enable network (voice) services creation, assurance and delivery on a massive scale. Based on an analysis of the Intelligent Networks in telecommunications to identify proven concepts and key lessons that can be applied to enable next generation IT datacenters experience this paper asserts that: • In order to scale cloud services reliably to millions of service developers and billions of end users the next generation cloud computing and datacenter infrastructure will have to follow an evolution similar to the one that led to the creation of scalable telecommunication networks. • In the future network-based cloud service providers will leverage virtualization technologies to be able to allocate just the right levels of virtualized compute, network and storage resources to individual applications based on real-time business demand while also providing full service level assurance of availability, performance and security at a reasonable cost. • A key component - identified in this paper as the Virtual Resource Mediation Layer (VRML), must be developed through industry collaboration to enable interoperability of various public and private clouds. This layer will form the basis for ensuring massive scalability of cloud infrastructure by enabling distributed service creation, service delivery and service assurance without any single vendor domination. • The next generation virtualization technologies must allow applications to dynamically access CPU, memory, bandwidth and storage (capacity, I/O and throughput) in a manner similar to that of the telecommunications 800 Service Call Model1 with one level of indirection and mediation. The authors believe that the next generation cloud evolution is a fundamental transformation - and not just an evolutionary stack of XaaS implementations, which will enable global service collaboration networks utilizing optimally distributed and managed computing, network and storage resources driven in real - time by business priorities. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is a term applied to large, hosted datacenters, usually geographically distributed, which offer various computational services on a "utility" basis. Most typically the configuration and provisioning of these datacenters, as far as the services for the subscribers go, is highly automated, to the point of the service being delivered within seconds of the subscriber request. Additionally, the datacenters typically use hypervisor based virtualization as a technique to deliver these services. The concept of a cloud operated by one service provider or enterprise interoperating with a clouds operated by another is a powerful idea. So far that is limited to use cases where code running on one cloud explicitly references a service on another cloud. There is no implicit and transparent interoperability. Use cases for interoperability, as well as work-inprogress around inter-cloud protocols and formats for enabling those use cases, are discussed in this paper. © 2009 IEEE.},

A trend driving the demand for people-centric ECM is the global economic crisis and the resulting need for corporations to make current resources do more. The fast adoption rate of Microsoft's SharePoint server for building team-specific collaboration sites with its built-in ECM capabilities is evidence of demand for a truly collaborative product. IBM announced a new agile ECM portfolio of product enhancements in October 2008 that cuts down on deployment time by using a service-oriented architecture approach. EMC debuted its Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) in March 2009, a specification which uses web services and Web 2.0 interfaces to enable applications to interoperate with multiple ECM repositories from different vendors. The continued adoption of cloud computing will make ECM integration simplicity a customer demand, as corporate data will reside increasingly both inside and outside the firewall.},

abstract={All of the military services are actively seeking improved tools and methods for providing warfighters with improved situation awareness of battlefield conditions. RAM Laboratories is working to emphasize the advantages of moving simulation activities away from big, complex, vertically integrated simulation systems running on dedicated high-powered platforms. We are moving instead towards a new model of service-oriented simulation providing access to modular domain-specific simulation models that fully support dynamic composition and varying patterns of connectivity between multiple light-weight nodes. These distributed simulation capabilities can be readily combined with advanced analysis techniques, including knowledge inferencing and hypothesis testing, within a service-oriented architecture (SOA) framework to provide situation awareness solutions that are robust and resilient to the effects of incomplete and unreliable data sources. The paper discusses the design of a service-oriented simulation software framework as part of a broader approach towards generating improved levels of actionable views of situation awareness; an approach that aligns and scales with current trends towards the increased use of SOA and cloud computing technologies. The paper describes design features that enable powerful and flexible access to distributed simulation capabilities, increased opportunities for software component reuse, and rapid development and deployment of new applications utilizing multiple levels of simulation capabilities.},

abstract={The exciting developments in the World Wide Web (WWW) have revived interest in computer simulation for modeling, particularly for conceiving simulation languages and building model libraries that can be assembled and executed over the Internet, and for analysis, particularly for developing simulation optimization algorithms for parallel experimentation. This paper contributes to this second stream of research by introducing a framework for Optimization via Simulation (OvS) through Parallel Replicated Discrete Event Simulation (PRDES). In particular, we combine Nested Partitions (NP) and Extended Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (EOCBA) to provide an efficient framework for PRDES experiments. The number of candidate alternatives to be evaluated can be reduced by the application of NP. EOCBA, a modification of the Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) for PRDES, minimizes the number of simulation replications required to evaluate a particular alternative by allocating computing resources to potentially critical alternatives. We deploy web services technologies based on the Java Axis and NET framework to create a viable infrastructure for heterogeneous PRDES systems. This approach, which receives increasing attention under the banners of 'grid computing' and 'cloud computing,' further promotes reusability, scalability, and interoperability. Experimental results with a prototype implementation not only furnish a proof of concept but also illustrate significant gains in simulation efficiency with PRDES. The proposed concept and techniques can also be applied to simulation models that require coordination and interoperation in heterogeneous environments, such as decentralized supply chains. © 2009, SAGE Publications.

abstract={In the European context, Italian legislation bodies have intervened on several occasions and time and time again through regulatory interventions aimed at regulating the use of ICT both in the Public Administration and the private sector. The aim of this work is to ascertain why the most advanced regulations and most widespread technologies alone cannot manage to bridge the current and verifiable gap between Public Administration and Information Communication Technologies. We will firstly address the evolution of the legislation and make particular reference to the Italian situation as well as analyse the European funding programmes for implementing ICT in the PA and we will then study the factors preventing ICT's real, successful penetration in the public structure and the role of digital culture. For the authors, the lack of an adequate digital culture for both old and new generations of digital citizens is the real reason for the current gap between ICT and the PA. Young citizens - Strength: they are included within the definition of digital natives. Using technologies to communicate-exchange-share comes naturally to them. Weakness: they lack adequate digital education to get the most out of the tools at their disposal. Result: complete immaturity in the knowledge of their own rights and especially their own duties. The old generation of digital citizens - Strength: population of seniors who are fundamentally curious and conscious of ICT news, especially in relation to the PA; confident in a support essential to simplifying their existence. Weakness: a) distrust often born of false information about new ICT tools for their benefit; b) incompatibility and incommunicability between information systems from various Public Administrations; c) citizen interoperability procedures/PA sometimes still too confusing or unclear and characterised by haphazard development, with areas (and offices and/or local administrations) that are extremely developed alternated with areas that have remained behind. During this analysis we cannot forget the concept of broadband internet access as synonymous with fast access to the network. The possibility of use facilitated by a 2.0 internet structure for the citizen. Broadband internet access as a citizen's right. European and national overview. The difference between the idea of broadband internet access as a citizen's right in Italy and other European countries will also be explored: in Switzerland (in 2008), in Finland (in 2010, each of the approximately 5 million Finns will have the right to a minimum speed connection of 1Mbps and broadband, currently in a transitional period, that should reach 100 Mbps by 2015); in Spain (in 2011). In Italy: Professor Rodotà recently spoke of this, in an intentionally defiant tone, so as to unofficially push for a solution to the problem. In fact, our legal system already guarantees the right to Internet in article 3 of the Italian Constitution. In conclusion, the characteristics of service providers will be examined as well the reasons for not having an open standardisation for internet access as yet another phenomenon to negatively influence the ICT and Public Administration relationship.},

abstract={Experience in World Wide Web (Web) accessibility has taught us: to think about small bespoke solutions; to tailor interaction and requirements to the user and job at hand; to value high data interoperability; to realise that large enterprise systems, become unmanageable and unable to change at the speed required by both users and technology; and finally, to value heterogeneity. Indeed, with the advent of Workflows, Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), Representational state transfer (RESTful) services, and Cloud Computing we can also see these viewpoints becoming more common in mainstream thought. Here, we use Bernstein's concept of 'NeoVictorian Computing' as a counterfoil to Andriole's new viewpoint of 21st century software development. We extrapolate from the Web development model into corporate and enterprise systems and propose an architecture of client based heterogeneous applications each tailored to a specific user, and their job, with highly interoperable data, controlled by workflows that are transferred with the data itself. We discount the new client - computing fad, as this really means centrally controlled, sometimes unavailable, old style enterprise systems. We suggest that by moving toward user centred agile systems we follow the conceptual, if not the technological, underpinnings of the Web. In this case we realise that Web developers are in a privileged position to shape and push forward this new kind of software architecture and the 'craft' based approaches which will drive it.

abstract={This keynote describes the evolution of massively distributed computing systems and their key techniques. Clusters of computers now prevail, expand, and become the core components in large-scale computational/ information/data Grids. The Open Grid Service Architecture, specifying the Grid software, protocol, and service standards, are only partially implemented in Globus and other Grid toolkits. Grid security demand globalization among various PKI authorities and interoperability between wired and wireless networks. Very little progress being made in special networks, hardware, languages, and operating systems for Grid/Cloud computing. Business Grids/Clouds are under development by Google, IBM, Sun, Microsoft, etc., and widespread acceptance is hindered by selfish behavior and security concerns. Briefly, the keynote includes rise and fall of computing technologies and hot paradigms in the last 35 Years, and presents the implication that computing clouds over the Internet will be the next battlefield among competitors. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
