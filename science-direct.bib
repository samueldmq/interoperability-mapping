This lack of standardization is caused by the vendor lock-in problem, where cloud providers use various techniques (languages, standards, ontologies, models, etc.) to describe cloud services. Furthermore, there are few studies which dealt with the four aspects of service especially the technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. Whereas, many other studies dealt only with some of these four aspects. This is the case of \{WSDL\} (Web Service Description Language) language, which focuses in the technical aspect, but it does not cover business and semantic ones. Our objective in this paper is to identify the foundations of a standardized \{CSD\} covering the technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. We present a comparative study of the different approaches that address \{CSD\} issues. The result of this comparative study shows that \{USDL\} (Unified Service Description Language) is the appropriate language supporting a service description by covering three aspects (technical, operational, and business), despite its inability to cover the semantic aspect.

Federation increases consumer value for and facilitates providing \{IT\} services as a commodity. This business model for the Cloud is consistent with broker mediated supply and service delivery chains in other commodity sectors such as finance and manufacturing. Concreteness is added to the federated Cloud model by considering how it works in delivering the Weather Research and Forecasting service (WRF) as SaaS using PaaS and IaaS support. \{WRF\} is used to illustrate the concepts of delegation and federation, the translation of service requirements between service layers, and inter-Cloud broker functions needed to achieve federation.

Meanwhile, cloud computing provides people with the resources in a pay-as-you-go style, i.e. charging for the use of resources. However, cloud computing cannot make people use everything in a cloud without caring about their own investments and resources. While cloud computing nowadays only cares about how to rent resources to people, people need a solution capable of combining their own resources and the rented resources to get the maximum benefit, i.e. the solution to customize a cloud according to people's needs. In this paper, the \{PROgram\} Ultra-Dispatcher (PROUD) is proposed for launching applications in a customization manner on cloud computing. The \{PROUD\} allows people to configure using their own computers or Virtual Machines (VMs) in clouds to run applications, no matter the applications are installed in people's computers or \{VMs\} in clouds. The \{PROUD\} allows people to regulate a rule for determining what computer or \{VM\} is capable of running the application according to available run-time information such as \{CPU\} utilization, available memory, network activity, disk space or I/O activity, etc. Furthermore, the \{PROUD\} allows people to setup preference to affect the decision procedure of choosing a capable computer or VM. Functioning as a program loader in people's computers, the \{PROUD\} has high interoperability among \{VMs\} to work well without a limitation in using the same Cloud Service Provider's VMs. Because people usually rent parts of pay-as-you-go resources in clouds such as a couple of VMs, the \{PROUD\} is justified to be a solution capable of combining their own resources and the rented resources to get the maximum benefit. Currently, the \{PROUD\} is implemented on Windows \{XP\} with a script file written in a portable language, so the \{PROUD\} has high portability among Windows platforms and high acceptability to people who are familiar with Windows platforms. The \{PROUD\} is given experiments in this paper to identify its practicability, overhead, and performance. "

While it can be straightforward to choose the best provider when deploying small and homogeneous applications, things get more challenging with large and complex applications. In this paper we propose qbrokage, a genetic approach for Cloud Brokering, aiming at finding Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) resources for satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of cloud applications. Our approach is capable of evaluating such requirements both for the single application service and for the application as whole. We performed a set of experiments with an implementation of such broker, by considering three-tier applications and scientific application workflows. Results show that our broker can find near-optimal solutions even when dealing with hundreds of providers, providing optimized deployment solutions that includes data transferring cost across multiple clouds.

This is achieved via introducing a simple and powerful DBMS-based system of deploying \{VM\} images from a Cloud environment in order to fulfill particular requests of task execution coming from a Grid environment. From a user point of view, resource authorization and access are kept unchanged, thus preserving the user experience related to the Grid. From the accounting point of view, in order to inform the Grid sites that a certain resource is available on a given Cloud-enabled Grid site, the information is published on the Grid information system. In this so-delineated scenario, we are able of using the powerful capability of distributing jobs of the Grid in order to allocate resources not only belonging to Grid clusters, but also with different architectures like GPUs, \{FPGAs\} and other systems. The target DBMS-based system has been designed for orchestrate a set of computing systems able to provide physical and virtual resources, creating a unified system, in which the various users-submitted computing tasks are managed and optimized.

This chapter studies some examples of popular SaaS applications that not only provide service-enabled solutions but also provide a platform where developers can rapidly create and customize newer applications in the same domain. It begins with the description of Salesforce.com, one of the very well-known SaaS cloud applications that delivers a \{CRM\} service. This is followed by a description of social computing services and then Google Docs, which are important consumer applications. The Google Docs example produced some additional insights. Though this SaaS application can be considered as a simple portal which enables hosting, sharing, and viewing of documents, the extra features to support interoperability and reliability are interesting.

However, each cloud provider uses its own techniques (languages, standards, ontologies, or models, etc.) to describe cloud services. The diversity of these techniques leads to the vendor lock-in problem, and thus, the lack of a cloud service description standardization. In addition, existing service descriptions cover only particular aspects and neglect others. For example, \{WSDL\} covers only technical aspect and does not cover business and semantic ones. Our objective is to define a standardized cloud service description that covers technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. In this paper, we introduce different approaches that have dealt with cloud service description, and thus, we adopt \{USDL\} language as an appropriate technique to describe cloud services thanks to its expressivity by covering three perspectives (technical, operational, and business). But, \{USDL\} is still limited because it cannot cover semantic aspect and it is not intended for cloud computing domain. After that, we highlight \{USDL\} limitations that can appear in cloud computing domain and that should be taken into consideration in our research work. This paper will focus on establishing a WSMO-based ontology to define semantically cloud services. This new cloud service description is based on \{USDL\} and we will enhance it by taking into consideration some \{USDL\} limitations. Finally, we test our proposed cloud service description model on a case study to prove its applicability. "

Although still under development, the range of circumstances to engage in monopolistic and anti-competitive behaviour in the cloud services market are numerous. Suppliers can engage in tying, exclusive dealing, and refusing to share vital information to allow the creation of technically compatible products. Monopolistic behaviour and pricing strategies can also restrict innovation and result in a lessening of competition. This paper reviews the European laws that have a direct effect on competition in the cloud computing industry. In addition to competition law, other areas of law have an impact on competition in cloud services. Merger regulations for example have a direct effect by controlling market concentrations in the cloud and technology industry. Interoperability has emerged as a key policy and legal consideration in cases concerning competition and merger laws. The concept of interoperability has arisen in cloud computing cases, as well as other areas of law that indirectly impact upon openness and competition. These areas include intellectual property and standardisation. As new areas of interest arise that raise enforcement challenges for regulators, the author maintains that current laws are adequate to meet the competition concerns in the diverse cloud services market.

Business Process as a Service (BPaaS), a new cloud service model, has recently gained a great importance for outsourcing cloud-based business processes constructed for multi-tenancy. In such a multi-tenant environment, using configurable business process models enables the sharing of a reference process among different tenants that can be customized according to specific needs. With a large choice of configurable process modeling languages, different providers may deliver configurable processes with common functionalities but different representations which makes the process discovery and configuration a manual tedious task. This in turn creates cloud silos and vendors lock-in with non-reusable configurable \{BPaaS\} models. Therefore, with the aim of enabling the interoperability between multiple \{BPaaS\} providers, we propose in this paper a semantic framework for \{BPaaS\} configurable models. Taking advantage of Semantic Web technologies and data mining techniques, our framework allows for (1) an ontology-based high level abstract representation of \{BPaaS\} configurable models enriched with configuration guidelines and (2) an automated approach for extracting the configuration guidelines from existing process repositories. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we extend Signavio with our semantic framework and conduct experiments on a dataset from \{SAP\} reference model. "

One of the most important barriers to the adoption of SaaS systems in cloud computing environments is interoperability. A common tactic for enabling interoperability is the use of an interoperability framework or model. During the past few years, in cloud SaaS level, various interoperability frameworks and models have been developed to provide interoperability between systems. The syntactic interoperability of SaaS systems have already been intensively researched. However, not enough consideration has been given to semantic interoperability issues. Achieving semantic interoperability is a challenge within the world of SaaS in cloud computing environments. Therefore, a semantic interoperability framework for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments is needed. We develop a semantic interoperability framework for cloud SaaS systems. The capabilities and value of service oriented architecture for semantic interoperability within cloud SaaS systems have been studied and demonstrated. This paper is accomplished through a number of steps (research methodology). It begins with a study on related works in the literature. Then, problem statement and research objectives are explained. In the next step, semantic interoperability requirements for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments that are needed to support are analyzed. The details of the proposed semantic interoperability framework for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments are presented. It includes the design of the proposed semantic interoperability framework. Finally, the evaluation methods of the semantic interoperability framework are elaborated. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic interoperability framework for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments, extensive experimentation and statistical analysis have been performed. The experiments and statistical analysis specify that the proposed semantic interoperability framework for cloud SaaS systems is able to establish semantic interoperability between cloud SaaS systems in a more efficient way. It is concluded that using the proposed framework, there is a significant improvement in the effectiveness of semantic interoperability of SaaS systems in cloud computing environments. "

To address these problems, we propose a Deduplication-Assisted primary storage system in Cloud-of-Clouds (short for DAC) in this paper. \{DAC\} eliminates the redundant data blocks in the cloud computing environment and distributes the data among multiple independent cloud storage providers by exploiting the data reference characteristics. In DAC, the data blocks are stored in multiple cloud storage providers by combing the replication and erasure code schemes. To better utilize the advantages of both replication and erasure code schemes and exploit the reference characteristics in data deduplication, the high referenced data blocks are stored with the replication scheme while the other data blocks are stored with the erasure code scheme. The experiments conducted on our lightweight prototype implementation show that \{DAC\} improves the performance and cost efficiency significantly, compared with the existing schemes. "

A Gartner survey has shown that one of the major inhibitors to cloud computing is the lack of standardization leading to vendor lock-in. This is partly due to the fact that cloud computing is rapidly evolving, making standardization difficult. The chapter begins with the surveys of new standards that have the potential to address this concern. Another problem with vendor lock-in is that even if standards were to emerge, currently there is no accepted method for a cloud user to compare different cloud vendors and select the best for a particular application. This is in contrast to the situation in, say, databases, where there are benchmarks such as TPC-C that allow different database vendors to be compared. Following this, the chapter describes efforts underway to develop benchmarks that can help in assessing the suitability of a particular cloud system for an application. Open Cirrus, a large research testbed for research in cloud-computing technology, which may be very useful for readers interested in experimenting with novel cloud solutions or algorithms, is described. Finally, the chapter discusses research efforts that would make it possible for users who are not programmers to develop personal applications with simple scripts and programs. "

This amount of raw data introduces new scalability challenges in processing, storing and analyzing it, which cannot be solved using a single workstation, the only resource available for the majority of biological scientists, in a reasonable amount of time. These scalability challenges can be complemented by provisioning computational and storage resources using Cloud Computing in a cost-effective manner. There are multiple cloud providers offering cloud resources as a utility within various business models, service levels and functionalities. However, the lack of standards in cloud computing leads to interoperability issues among the providers rendering the selected one unalterable. Furthermore, even a single provider offers multiple configurations to choose from. Therefore, it is essential to develop a decision making system that facilitates the selection of the suitable cloud provider and configuration together with the capability to switch among multiple providers in an efficient and transparent manner. In this paper, we propose BioCloud as a single point of entry to a multi-cloud environment for non-computer savvy bio-researchers. We discuss the architecture and components of BioCloud and present the scheduling algorithm employed in BioCloud. Experiments with different use-cases and scenarios reveal that BioCloud can decrease the workflow execution time for a given budget while encapsulating the complexity of resource management in multiple cloud providers.

With multiple sellers providing appropriately equivalent virtual machines they become fungible, offering the opportunity for users to swap instances from one seller with instances from another when required, easing concerns over vendor lock-in, availability and provider failure. However, heterogeneity in the hardware from which they are provisioned is likely inevitable, given heterogeneity already found on a number of Public Clouds, where it results in performance variation across instances of the same type, and consequently variation in Cloud costs at the same price. To address this problem we propose a Cloud Service Broker (CSB) that acquires and re-sells instances on the basis of their current performance. The service reduces performance risk for users, but comes at a cost. We determine the average markup the \{CSB\} must add to the base instance price to cover the costs of operating a pool capable of satisfying a given proportion of requests. We show how increases in heterogeneity on the underlying commodity exchange lead to lower costs for the CSB, and that the largest degree of heterogeneity we consider, on the basis of real-world findings, leads to the best outcome: an average markup of just 12% on the buy price from the exchange will satisfy 95% of requests. This creates opportunities for \{CSB\} profitability to be explored on the basis of selling performance-assured instances at prices that will account for this markup "

Information technology market leaders, e.g., Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, are extensively shifting toward cloud-based solutions. However, there is isolation in the cloud implementations provided by the cloud vendors. Limited interoperability can cause one user to adhere to a single cloud provider; thus, a required migration of an application or data from one cloud provider to another may necessitate a significant effort and/or full-cycle redevelopment to fit the new provider's standards and implementation. The ability to move from one cloud vendor to another would be a step toward advancing cloud computing interoperability and increasing customer trust. This study proposes a cloud broker solution to fill the interoperability gap between different software-as-a-service providers. The proposed cloud broker was implemented and tested on a real enterprise application dataset. The migration process was completed and it worked correctly, according to a specified mapping model. "

But due to the slow development of a scalable \{IT\} infrastructure, this can lead to issues in competitiveness. Software defined networking (SDN) can thereby counteract such issues by giving new functions to the whole network topology. With SDN, administrators have the possibility to abstract the underlying network infrastructure for applications and network services. The paper reports on the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on challenges and effects of SDN. It shows that most papers address the implementation of software defined networking as a challenge, including factors like vendor lock-in and the general risk of changing traditional network architectures. Attention is also given to security issues arising with software defined networks and the permanent high demand from the end-user combined with the fear of changing traditional networks. Issues dealing with specialized know-how were identified as another challenge category. Effects of \{SDN\} are discussed by defining unique features of \{SDN\} like decoupling hardware from the software and the global view of the whole network architecture. \{SDN\} furthermore affects the management of the network, including changes in deployment of policies, the programmability and maintenance of the network. Economic factors, such as cost efficiency and reduction of costs, are also discussed. "

The customers of these closed software service platforms are locked-in. Potential customers, who are aware of this lock-in issue, are hesitant to adopt a closed software service platform, slowing down the wide deployment of the software service platform. This paper applies an economic perspective to investigate the value creation for providers and users at different levels of interoperability. For the analysis, a value creation model for software service platforms within a software service ecosystem has been developed. Simulations of the value creation model show that, even if investments in interoperability and portability are aimed at addressing user requirements, their impact also drives the providers’ profitability. Furthermore, emerging providers require investing more than market leading providers, as they have less power to set de facto standards. The simulation results also show that there is an optimal level of investments, with respect to profit and return on investments. Overall, from these results, platform providers cannot only obtain an understanding on how investments in interoperability and portability impact cost, enable cost-effective service integration, and create value, but also design new strategies for optimizing investments.

With the lack of interoperability between stakeholders in current healthcare compute and storage infrastructure as well as the volume of data involved, our ability to measure quality of care across the healthcare system is either limited or non-existent.

However, the cloud computing system performance may deteriorate with increasing number of users and become worse when many users access the video streaming from the cloud system. This is due to the centralized architecture of the cloud computing that can generate network traffic congestion and bottleneck in the cloud servers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture has been proposed to overcome this problem. Using P2P, all nodes in the cloud system can act as servers as well as clients at the same time for reducing the congestion and bottleneck of the system. Currently, there are few reviews on \{P2P\} video streaming although intensive studies have been done on the development of the system. With this condition, identifying and understanding the development of \{P2P\} video streaming will be expensive, time consuming and physically exhausting. The objective of this paper is to review the latest development of \{P2P\} video streaming based on cloud computing. A narrative review method has been used as the methodology for investigating the \{P2P\} video streaming’ articles from 2009 to 2014. The outcomes of this research shows that 90% of cloud based e-learning integrate with \{P2P\} when it's involving streaming video. "

This paper presents a middleware for performing hybrid simulation of large-scale critical systems. The services offered by the middleware allow the integration and interoperability of simulated and emulated subsystems, compliant with the reference interoperability standards, which can provide greater realism of the scenario under test. The hybrid simulation of complex critical systems is a research challenge due to the interoperability issues of emulated and simulated subsystems and to the cost associated with the scenarios to set up, which involve a large number of entities and expensive long running simulations. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to optimize the simulation task allocation on a private cloud. "

As switching to a different system is costly, customers of a closed \{IT\} system can be considered locked in. Consequently, potential customers, who are aware of this lock-in issue, do not adopt cloud services. Opening up an \{IT\} service platform, however, reduces users’ concerns about lock-in and its associated switching cost. It is even predicted that an \{IT\} service platform gets more attractive, if it opens up. This paper validates this prediction by analyzing the level of openness (i.e., interoperability, portability, and usability) of cloud computing platforms on their adoption. For the validation, we develop a value creation model for \{IT\} service platforms. Based on this value creation model and a specification of requirements of open cloud computing platforms, the relationship between the openness of \{IT\} service platforms and the adoption of \{IT\} service platforms (i.e., attractiveness) is analyzed in detail.

Consequently, several new approaches to its use and optimization have been implemented to maintain continuity of technology. In this way, multiple clouds organizations have been formed with the objective of maximizing the use of cloud computing, in particular small- and medium-sized cloud providers who present difficulties to maintain all properties of the paradigm have mobilized themselves into organizations to maximize their revenues. Such organizations, formally called inter-clouds, have been gaining attention, where solutions like hybrid clouds, multi-clouds, and cloud federations are the main elements in the academic–scientific and industrial world. In particular, cloud federations are well behaved because organizations governed by a contract can be interesting and useful in many critical environments. However, there is a lack of works dedicated only to clouds federations. In addition, the existing works are not able to describe federations as unique inter-cloud entities to highlight specific properties and characteristics.

However, since current distributed simulation interoperability methods are coupled with system implementations, they place constraints on enhancing interoperability and synchronization algorithms. To enhance simulation interoperability on the Web, we implemented the \{RISE\} (RESTful Interoperability Simulation Environment) middleware, the first existing simulation middleware to be based on \{RESTful\} Web-services (WS). \{RISE\} is a general middleware that serves as a container to hold different simulation environments without being specific to a certain environment. \{RISE\} can hold heterogeneous simulations, and it exposes them as services via the Web. One of such services is called Distributed CD++ (DCD++) simulation system, an extension of the CD++ core engine that allows executing \{DEVS\} and Cell-DEVS models. Here, we introduce a proof-of-concept design and implementation of DCD++ using the distributed simulation using the \{RISE\} environment. We show how the \{RESTful\} \{WS\} interoperability style in \{RISE\} has improved the design, implementation and the performance of the DCD++ simulator. We also discuss a substantial performance improvement of the implementation of the RISE-based DCD++ presented here, showing many advantages of the \{RESTful\} \{WS\} presented here: improved interoperability, a seamless method to be connected into a cloud computing environment, and performance improvement when compared to our SOAP-based DCD++ in a similar testing environment.

Due to its strength in terms of scalability, interoperability, and efficiency, the application of \{REST\} has been adopted in further domains including service-oriented architectures and cloud computing. Consequently, \{REST\} is gaining traction as an approved concept for implementing IoT systems on a large scale.

abstract = "Abstract Cloud computing (CC) is one of the most popular technologies which provides on-demand ubiquitous services to the geo-located end users. Such services are hosted by physical infrastructure deployed at massive data centers (DCs) at various geographic locations. For handling millions of service requests, \{DCs\} consume a large amount of energy which increases the overall operational expenditure, grid load, and carbon footprints. So, to handle these issues, the integration of \{DCs\} with renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the solutions used by the research community from past many years. However, with an increase in smart communities such as-smart cities, smart healthcare, and Internet of things (IoT), the dependence of users on \{CC\} has increased many folds. Hence, to deal with the service requests and the data generated from smart devices (vehicles, IoT sensors, and actuators) locally, a recent paradigm popularly known as Edge computing has emerged. But, to execute various applications smoothly, there is a movement of high volume of data across different geographically separated nodes which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. Moreover, the interoperability of various mobile devices is one of the major concerns for effective network infrastructure usage. Hence, to deal with above challenges, an emerging paradigm known as software defined networks (SDN) can be a suitable choice. Hence, in this paper, an efficient scheme for energy management with sustainability (MEnSuS) of Cloud Data Centers in Edge-Cloud Environment using \{SDN\} is presented. In the proposed scheme, a support vector machine-based workload classification approach is presented. Moreover, a two-stage game for workload scheduling for sustainability of \{DCs\} is designed. In order to achieve energy efficiency and optimal utilization of network and computing resources, different consolidation schemes are also presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Google workload traces and the results obtained prove the effectiveness. "

Consequently vendor lock in becomes a common problem which multiple cloud users have to tackle in order to exploit the full potential of cloud computing. A scenario where component-based applications are developed for being deployed across several clouds, and each component can independently be deployed in one cloud or another, remains fictitious due to the complexity and the cost of their development. This paper presents a cloud development framework for developing cloud agnostic applications that may be deployed indifferently across multiple cloud platforms. Information about cloud deployment and cloud integration is separated from the source code and managed by the framework. Interoperability between interdependent components deployed in different clouds is achieved by automatically generating services and service clients. This allows software developers to segment their applications into different modules that can easily be deployed and redistributed across heterogeneous cloud platforms. "

The emerging concepts of federated clouds with support for interoperability between different cloud providers and open standards in cloud middleware have opened up new challenges in cloud service management.

This is of importance when the quality of a cloud service currently used by a user degrades or a new cloud service is developed which is better in terms of quality, performance and cost than the current service being used. In such scenarios, the user needs to make a decision as to whether to continue with the currently used service or migrate to the newly available service. In our previous work, we presented a decision-making approach that assists a cloud service user in selecting a cloud service provider based on the QoS of its services.

Mobile devices are looking towards cloud-aware techniques, driven by their growing interest to provide ubiquitous PC-like functionality to mobile users. These functionalities mainly target at increasing storage and computational capabilities. Smartphones may integrate those functionalities from different cloud levels, in a service oriented manner within the mobile applications, so that a mobile task can be delegated by direct invocation of a service. However, developing these kind of mobile cloud applications requires to integrate and consider multiple aspects of the clouds, such as resource-intensive processing, programmatically provisioning of resources (Web APIs) and cloud intercommunication. To overcome these issues, we have developed a Mobile Cloud Middleware (MCM) framework, which addresses the issues of interoperability across multiple clouds, asynchronous delegation of mobile tasks and dynamic allocation of cloud infrastructure. \{MCM\} also fosters the integration and orchestration of mobile tasks delegated with minimal data transfer. A prototype of \{MCM\} is developed and several applications are demonstrated in different domains. To verify the scalability of MCM, load tests are also performed on the hybrid cloud resources. The detailed performance analysis of the middleware framework shows that \{MCM\} improves the quality of service for mobiles and helps in maintaining soft-real time responses for mobile cloud applications.

We observe that new resources at public clouds positively affect the market from the end-user perspective.

Consistent with its growth, there has been wide research interest in the literature that focuses on increasing cloud adoption. However, the current commercial and research-oriented cloud computing research in the literature mainly deals with functionalities closer to cloud infrastructure, such as improved performance and the management of virtualized resources, as well as fundamental issues related to efficient resource utilization, such as virtual machine (VM) migrations and server consolidation. While on the one hand, such features are very important, on the other hand, other important features, such as cloud quality of service management which is important for the cloud environment to move from a basic cloud service infrastructure to a broader cloud service ecosystem, have not received the required due attention. In cloud service management, a cloud service user has several choices for service selection and the quest to achieve interoperability and compatibility in cloud computing will consequently enable the user to easily migrate between service providers. In this scenario, the user needs to make important cloud service management decisions based on QoS, in addition to other criteria such as usage cost. These issues, when considered from a user׳s perspective, are quite different from cloud infrastructure management issues envisioned from a cloud provider׳s perspective. There are several challenges in cloud service management from a user׳s perspective, which the current cloud service management platforms in the literature do not address. To address this drawback, this paper presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art discussion on the existing approaches to cloud service management, critically evaluates them against the factors required for the user to manage the cloud service and presents a framework that assists the cloud service user in making cloud service management decisions.

IoT acts as an enabler to interconnect intelligent and self-configurable nodes “things” to establish an efficient and dynamic platform for communication and collaboration. IoT is becoming a major source of big data, contributing huge amounts of streamed information from a large number of interconnected nodes, which have to be stored, processed, and presented in an efficient, and easily interpretable form. Cloud computing can enable IoT to have the privilege of a virtual resources utilization infrastructure, which integrates storage devices, visualization platforms, resource monitoring, analytical tools, and client delivery. Given the number of things connected and the amount of data generated, a key challenge is the energy efficient composition and interoperability of heterogeneous things integrated with cloud resources and scattered across the globe, in order to create an on-demand energy efficient cloud based IoT application. In many cases, when a single service is not enough to complete the business requirement; a composition of web services is carried out. These composed web services are expected to collaborate towards a common goal with large amount of data exchange and various other operations. Massive data sets have to be exchanged between several geographically distributed and scattered services. The movement of mass data between services influences the whole application process in terms of energy consumption. One way to significantly reduce this massive data exchange is to use fewer services for a composition, which need to be created to complete a business requirement. Integrating fewer services can result in a reduction in data interchange, which in return helps in reducing the energy consumption and carbon footprint. This paper develops a novel multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm called (E2C2) that aims at creating an energy-aware composition plan by searching for and integrating the least possible number of IoT services, in order to fulfil user requirements. A formal user requirements translation and transformation modelling and analysis is adopted for the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated against four established service composition algorithms in multiple cloud environments (All clouds, Base cloud, Smart cloud, and COM2), with the results demonstrating the superior performance of our approach.

The user can request instances of such entities to implement a monitoring infrastructure. The paradigm does not target a specific cloud model, and is therefore applicable to any kind of resource provided as a service. The specifications include only the minimum needed to describe a monitoring infrastructure, thus making this standard extension simple and easily adoptable. Despite its simplicity, the model is able to describe complex solutions, including private/public clouds, and covers both infrastructure and application monitoring. To highlight the impact of our proposal in practice, we have designed an engine that deploys a monitoring infrastructure using its OCCI-compliant descriptions.

This is particularly true in the aerospace industry: a highly-competitive and demanding business supported by numerous applications, which may be general-purposed, specific, proprietary or open-sourced, all needing to be interoperable with the lowest impact on the business itself. This paper addresses the need for improving the sustainability of enterprise interoperability via the application of negotiations, with the objective of reducing the impact of changes and achieving the best solutions in the interoperability between the enterprises and their surrounding environment.

Although semantic web technologies provide the solution to web data interoperability by storing the semantic web standard in relational databases for processing and analyzing of web-accessible heterogeneous digital data, web data storage and retrieval via the predefined schema of relational / \{SQL\} databases has become increasingly inefficient with the advent of big data. In response to this problem, the Hadoop Ecosystem System is being adopted to reduce the complexity of moving data to and from the big data cloud platform. This paper proposes a novel approach in a set of the Hadoop tools for information integration and interoperability across hyperconnected manufacturing collaboration systems. In the Hadoop approach, data is “Extracted” from the web sources, “Loaded” into a set of the NoSQL Hadoop Database (HBase) tables, and then “Transformed” and integrated into the desired format model with Hive's schema-on-read. A case study was conducted to illustrate that the Hadoop Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) approach for the syntax and semantics web data integration could be adopted across the global smartphone value chain.

The platform is set on predefined and original statistical methodologies for accurate inference in CRC, biomarkers extraction, \{CRC\} stage prognosis, etc. In order to avoid the limitations of the local infrastructure, the proposed architecture takes the advantage of the cloud's speed and flexibility to perform large-scale computations and to be easily upgradable with new tools. The platform we present is equivalent to the Software as a Service level of abstraction from an end-user point of view. From a developer's point of view, we use the Platform as a Service level of abstraction, which means we control virtualized instances that are already offered by the Cloud Service Provider. Those instances are set on the Infrastructure as a Service level of the cloud, its storing and processing capacity. Mainly, the platform is comprised of four distinctive modules: User Interface – interface between the user, the software and the biological databases; Machine Learning – the core where the data is processed; Distributed Processing – splits and spreads the problem through the available instances; and Resources Controlling module – determines the best combination of resources in terms of performance and cost depending on the problem size.

The primary disadvantage for an \{SME\} to enter the emerging PaaS market is the possibility of being locked into a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants. The PaaSport project focuses on facilitating \{SMEs\} to deploy business applications on the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering and to seamlessly migrate these applications on demand, via a thin, non-intrusive Cloud-broker, in the form of a Cloud PaaS Marketplace. PaaSport enables PaaS provider \{SMEs\} to roll out semantically interoperable PaaS offerings, by annotating them using a unified PaaS semantic model that has been defined as an \{OWL\} ontology. In this paper we focus on the recommendation algorithm that has been developed on top of the ontology, for providing the application developer with recommendations about the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering. The algorithm consists of: a) a matchmaking part, where the functional parameters of the application are taken into account to rule out inconsistent offerings, and b) a ranking part, where the non-functional parameters of the application are considered to score and rank offerings. Τhe algorithm is extensively evaluated showing linear scalability to the number of offerings and application requirements. Furthermore, it is extensible upon future semantic model extensions, because it is agnostic to domain specific concepts and parameters, using \{SPARQL\} template queries. "

In a more centralized and seamless environment, it becomes important to view software as a service, or “SaaS”. In particular, ubiquitous healthcare urgently needs to reflect the view of the healthcare system as a service, “HaaS”, for the purposes of health promotion, disease prevention, and general well-being. Overcoming the current limitations of medical technologies, medical practices, and business, HaaS requires a more sustainable environment, including addressing issues of interoperability, service reuse, maintenance, and integration. This paper suggests a framework for realizing a HaaS model, focusing on vital signs-oriented systems. The proposed framework consists of four distinct modules: three modules for receiving, transforming, and analyzing vital signs and the fourth module, called a service-oriented architecture (SOA) component module, enabling access to medical services. We believe that the framework promises dramatic reductions in software development costs on the one hand and lays a foundation for users to access a rich and seamless service in a more convenient way on the other. This paper describes a framework for the HaaS model and presents an example service that we implemented, a calorie-tracking service, based on it. "

However, building such application topologies often results in reinventing the wheel multiple times when similar solutions are manually created by different developers for different applications having the same requirements. Thus, the reusability of existing \{TOSCA\} solutions is crucial to ease and support design and development processes. In this paper, we introduce and assess ToscaMart, a method that enables deriving valid implementations for custom components from a repository of cloud applications. The method enables developers to specify individual components in their application topologies, and illustrates how to match, adapt, and reuse existing fragments of applications to implement these components while fulfiling all their compliance requirements. We also validate ToscaMart by means of a prototypical implementation based on an open source toolchain and a case study. "

Current developments of software vendors trend to the outsourcing of the engineer's workstation to the cloud. However, in the foreseeable future companies will rely on hybrid environments where traditional tasks are handled by traditional applications and cloud platforms are used for more dynamical business areas. Furthermore, stakeholders in construction projects are geographically spread and work together only temporary. Traditional applications never were designed for this scenario. In this paper we introduce the BIMgrid, a work in progress to develop an innovative, adaptive infrastructure integration framework for civil engineering applications, based on private grid and public cloud resources. Although some middleware solutions for the efficient combination of hardware already exist, they are mostly based on \{UNIX\} and demand advanced technological knowledge to implement. We present our current state of work and give an overview about the architecture of the BIMgrid, the integration into an \{IT\} infrastructure, data management and the interfaces to use it's features with common applications. The prototype implementation is designed as a layered, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and offers several interfaces. Data Management in the \{BIMgrid\} will be based on vendor specific data formats and the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard and hence supports the interoperability between applications. Our prototype has been developed in several research projects and tested by industry partners under real conditions. We expect to reduce costs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through the automation of complex workflows, optimization of data transfer and reduction of the communication effort between stakeholders. Further we want to make benefits of grid and cloud computing accessible to companies, without dissipation of so far made hard- and software investments. "

In this study, we present a taxonomy of such technical issues that can impede the life cycle of multimedia-enabled m-learning applications. The taxonomy is devised based on the issues related to mobile device heterogeneity, network performance, content heterogeneity, content delivery, and user expectation.

However, the dilemma is how to share these properties of \{BIM\} applications on one single platform. Thus creating a service that would enable the end-user to use multiple of nDs such as, 3D (three dimensional modelling), 4D (time - programming), 5D (costing) and 6D (sustainability) actions asynchronously. The prospect of using remote data servers with web service applications provides a mechanism for exchanging data openly. The main exchange format for \{BIM\} files is Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the initial problem with \{IFCs\} is that they are not intended to store and carry all relevant data for all multi-featured construction processes. Furthermore, not all relevant data can be structured in a single super schema. This papers' methodology focuses on the results of a semi-structured interview of 11 expert respondents, on using cloud computing as integration platform for \{BIM\} applications ‘Cloud BIM’. The proposed model is not to introduce a new schema in contrast to \{IFC\} but to harness the capability of \{IFC\} \{XML\} and or possibly engage with using Simplified Markup Language (SML) subsets of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) for exchanging partial data to design an integrated platform that would enhance the \{BIM\} usability experience for various disciplines in making key design decisions at a relatively early design stage.

This approach raises several concerns, namely security issues and latency in communications. A gate in a public transportation device has to check ticket validity in less than 300ms. With this in mind, we propose a Cloud Ticketing Communication Testing Platform (SmartSales), developed to benchmark the normal ticketing operations (e.g., sale, recharge and validation), while providing insights on the latency, according to several levels of security, available network and Cloud topology. Several metrics associated with the round-trip time (RTT) of communications made by the prototype were collected to explore possible situations where the “thin device” concept can be used. The acquired results point towards the possible migration of most e-ticketing systems with the SmartCITIES Cloud Ticketing project architecture to the Cloud. "

The semantic and formal description of services and resources is also relevant to assist paradigms such as cloud computing, where a large diversity of resources have to be described and managed in a highly dynamic way. This paper defines an ontology for multiservice \{IP\} networks targeting multiple service management goals, namely: (i) to foster client and service provider interoperability; (ii) to manage network service contracts, promoting the dynamic negotiation between parties; (iii) to access and query SLA/SLSs data on a individual or aggregated basis to assist service provisioning in the network; and (iv) to sustain service monitoring and auditing.

This paper describes a visual \{SLAM\} system based on a distributed framework where the expensive map optimization and storage is allocated as a service in the Cloud, while a light camera tracking client runs on a local computer. The robot onboard computers are freed from most of the computation, the only extra requirement being an internet connection. The data flow from and to the Cloud is low enough to be supported by a standard wireless connection. The experimental section is focused on showing real-time performance for single-robot and cooperative \{SLAM\} using an \{RGBD\} camera. The system provides the interface to a map database where: (1) a map can be built and stored, (2) stored maps can be reused by other robots, (3) a robot can fuse its map online with a map already in the database, and (4) several robots can estimate individual maps and fuse them together if an overlap is detected.

abstract = "Abstract Cloud Computing and Service Oriented Architectures have seen a dramatic increase of the amount of applications, services, management platforms, data, etc. gaining momentum for the necessity of new complex methods and techniques to deal with the vast heterogeneity of data sources or services. In this sense Quality of Service (QoS) seeks for providing an intelligent environment of self-management components based on domain knowledge in which cloud components can be optimized easing the transition to an advanced governance environment. On the other hand, semantics and ontologies have emerged to afford a common and standard data model that eases the interoperability, integration and monitoring of knowledge-based systems. Taking into account the necessity of an interoperable and intelligent system to manage QoS in cloud-based systems and the emerging application of semantics in different domains, this paper reviews the main approaches for semantic-based QoS management as well as the principal methods, techniques and standards for processing and exploiting diverse data providing advanced real-time monitoring services. A semantic-based framework for QoS management is also outlined taking advantage of semantic technologies and distributed datastream processing techniques. Finally a discussion of existing efforts and challenges is also provided to suggest future directions. "

However, the Building and Construction industry (B&amp;C) has its \{ICT\} fragmented, having in the Building Information Model (BIM) paradigm a vehicle to address this problem. Interfacing with \{BIM\} brings another layer of complexity, mostly due to the heterogeneity of the systems and applications that need to interface with it. Thus, the adoption of a cluster of proper services in the Web that can offer in a unique way the functionalities needed for the adoption of BIM, is essential. The implementation of \{BIM\} under the Cloud Computing paradigm holds the promise of accelerating the B&amp;C industry to achieve the Single Electronic Market. After presenting the vision for a Single European Electronic Market, and the expectation of the B&amp;C sector to be integrated in a universal information space, this paper proposes the \{SOA4BIM\} framework as a cloud of services that enables universal access to the \{BIM\} paradigm by any system, application, or end user on the web.

abstract = "Abstract Cloud manufacturing is emerging as a novel business paradigm for the manufacturing industry, in which dynamically scalable and virtualised resources are provided as consumable services over the Internet. A handful of cloud manufacturing systems are proposed for different business scenarios, most of which fall into one of three deployment modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud, and public cloud. One of the challenges in the existing solutions is that few of them are capable of adapting to changes in the business environment. In fact, different companies may have different cloud requirements in different business situations; even a company at different business stages may need different cloud modes. Nevertheless, there is limited support on migrating to different cloud modes in existing solutions. This paper proposes a Hybrid Manufacturing Cloud that allows companies to deploy different cloud modes for their periodic business goals. Three typical cloud modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud and public cloud are supported in the system. Furthermore, it enables companies to set self-defined access rules for each resource so that unauthorised companies will not have access to the resource. This self-managed mechanism gives companies full control of their businesses and boosts their trust with enhanced privacy protection. A unified ontology is developed to enhance semantic interoperability throughout the whole process of service provision in the clouds. A Cloud Management Engine is developed to manage all the user-defined clouds, in which Semantic Web technologies are used as the main toolkit. The feasibility of this approach is verified through a group of companies, each of which has complex access requirements for their resources. In addition, a use case is carried out between customers and service providers. This way, optimal service is delivered through the proposed system. "
