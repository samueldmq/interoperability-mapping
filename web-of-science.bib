Abstract = {{In recent years, cloud computing paradigm has attracted a lot of
   attention from both industry and academia. However, each cloud provider
   uses its own techniques (languages, standards, ontologies, or models,
   etc.) to describe cloud services. The diversity of these techniques
   leads to the vendor lock-in problem, and thus, the lack of a cloud
   service description standardization. In addition, existing service
   descriptions cover only particular aspects and neglect others. For
   example, WSDL covers only technical aspect and does not cover business
   and semantic ones. Our objective is to define a standardized cloud
   service description that covers technical, operational, business, and
   semantic aspects. In this paper, we introduce different approaches that
   have dealt with cloud service description, and thus, we adopt USDL
   language as an appropriate technique to describe cloud services thanks
   to its expressivity by covering three perspectives (technical,
   operational, and business). But, USDL is still limited because it cannot
   cover semantic aspect and it is not intended for cloud computing domain.
   After that, we highlight USDL limitations that can appear in cloud
   computing domain and that should be taken into consideration in our
   research work. This paper will focus on establishing a WSMO-based
   ontology to define semantically cloud services. This new cloud service
   description is based on USDL and we will enhance it by taking into
   consideration some USDL limitations. Finally, we test our proposed cloud
   service description model on a case study to prove its applicability.

Title = {{QoS-aware genetic Cloud Brokering}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{75}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The broad diffusion of Cloud Computing has fostered the proliferation of
   a large number of cloud computing providers. The need of Cloud Brokers
   arises for helping consumers in discovering, considering and comparing
   services with different capabilities and offered by different providers.
   Moreover, consuming services exposed by different providers may
   alleviate the vendor lock-in issue. While it can be straightforward to
   choose the best provider when deploying small and homogeneous
   applications, things get more challenging with large and complex
   applications. In this paper we propose QBROKAGE, a genetic approach for
   Cloud Brokering, aiming at finding Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
   resources for satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of cloud
   applications. Our approach is capable of evaluating such requirements
   both for the single application service and for the application as
   whole. We performed a set of experiments with an implementation of such
   broker, by considering three-tier applications and scientific
   application workflows. Results show that our broker can find
   near-optimal solutions even when dealing with hundreds of providers,
   providing optimized deployment solutions that includes data transferring
   cost across multiple clouds. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{New and useful tools that facilitate the harmonization and
   interconnection of health data have become a requirement for monitoring
   and preventing illness and also for sharing medical knowledge. Nowadays,
   cloud-based solutions can support collaborative data science platforms

   investigate how cloud computing can be adopted within healthcare
   systems. The interoperability of existing technologies will improve the
   quality of life and the efficiency of healthcare systems by making them
   more personalized and centered on patients, together with reducing
   operational costs and medical errors. To have a socially acceptable
   health network service chain, the security and privacy issues need to be

Title = {{Optimized task allocation on private cloud for hybrid simulation of

Journal = {{FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{104-118}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Simulation represents a powerful technique for the analysis of
   dependability and performance aspects of distributed systems. For
   large-scale critical systems, simulation demands complex experimentation
   environments and the integration of different tools, in turn requiring
   sophisticated modeling skills. Moreover, the criticality of the involved
   systems implies the set-up of expensive testbeds on private
   infrastructures. This paper presents a middleware for performing hybrid
   simulation of large-scale critical systems. The services offered by the
   middleware allow the integration and interoperability of simulated and
   emulated subsystems, compliant with the reference interoperability
   standards, which can provide greater realism of the scenario under test.
   The hybrid simulation of complex critical systems is a research
   challenge due to the interoperability issues of emulated and simulated
   subsystems and to the cost associated with the scenarios to set up,
   which involve a large number of entities and expensive long running
   simulations. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization approach is
   proposed to optimize the simulation task allocation on a private cloud.

Journal = {{FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing popularity and rapid development of the cloud
   storage technology, more and more users are beginning to upload their
   data to the cloud storage platform. However, solely depending on a
   particular cloud storage provider has a number of potentially serious
   problems, such as vendor lock in, availability and security. To address
   these problems, we propose a Deduplication-Assisted primary storage
   system in Cloud-of-Clouds (short for DAC) in this paper. DAC eliminates
   the redundant data blocks in the cloud computing environment and
   distributes the data among multiple independent cloud storage providers
   by exploiting the data reference characteristics. In DAC, the data
   blocks are stored in multiple cloud storage providers by combing the
   replication and erasure code schemes. To better utilize the advantages
   of both replication and erasure code schemes and exploit the reference
   characteristics in data deduplication, the high referenced data blocks
   are stored with the replication scheme while the other data blocks are
   stored with the erasure code scheme. The experiments conducted on our
   lightweight prototype implementation show that DAC improves the
   performance and cost efficiency significantly, compared with the
   existing schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud service description (CSD) becomes an active area which attracts
   the attention of many research organizations, while no standard CSD
   exists. This lack of standardization is caused by the vendor lock-in
   problem, where cloud providers use various techniques (languages,
   standards, ontologies, models, etc.) to describe cloud services.
   Furthermore, there are few studies which dealt with the four aspects of
   service especially the technical, operational, business, and semantic
   aspects. Whereas, many other studies dealt only with some of these four
   aspects. This is the case of WSDL (Web Service Description Language)
   language, which focuses in the technical aspect, but it does not cover
   business and semantic ones. Our objective in this paper is to identify
   the foundations of a standardized CSD covering the technical,
   operational, business, and semantic aspects. We present a comparative
   study of the different approaches that address CSD issues. The result of
   this comparative study shows that USDL (Unified Service Description
   Language) is the appropriate language supporting a service description
   by covering three aspects (technical, operational, and business),
   despite its inability to cover the semantic aspect.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a shift in research towards the convergence of the
   Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms motivated by the
   need for IoT applications to leverage the unique characteristics of the
   cloud. IoT acts as an enabler to interconnect intelligent and
   self-configurable nodes ``things{''} to establish an efficient and
   dynamic platform for communication and collaboration. IoT is becoming a
   major source of big data, contributing huge amounts of streamed
   information from a large number of interconnected nodes, which have to
   be stored, processed, and presented in an efficient, and easily
   interpretable form. Cloud computing can enable IoT to have the privilege
   of a virtual resources utilization infrastructure, which integrates
   storage devices, visualization platforms, resource monitoring,
   analytical tools, and client delivery. Given the number of things
   connected and the amount of data generated, a key challenge is the
   energy efficient composition and interoperability of heterogeneous
   things integrated with cloud resources and scattered across the globe,
   in order to create an on-demand energy efficient cloud based IoT
   application. In many cases, when a single service is not enough to
   complete the business requirement; a composition of web services is
   carried out. These composed web services are expected to collaborate
   towards a common goal with large amount of data exchange and various
   other operations. Massive data sets have to be exchanged between several
   geographically distributed and scattered services. The movement of mass
   data between services influences the whole application process in terms
   of energy consumption. One way to significantly reduce this massive data
   exchange is to use fewer services for a composition, which need to be
   created to complete a business requirement. Integrating fewer services
   can result in a reduction in data interchange, which in return helps in
   reducing the energy consumption and carbon footprint.
   This paper develops a novel multi-cloud IoT service composition
   algorithm called (E2C2) that aims at creating an energy-aware
   composition plan by searching for and integrating the least possible
   number of IoT services, in order to fulfil user requirements. A formal
   user requirements translation and transformation modelling and analysis
   is adopted for the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated
   against four established service composition algorithms in multiple
   cloud environments (All clouds, Base cloud, Smart cloud, and COM2), with
   the results demonstrating the superior performance of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{The energy consumption of cloud computing continues to be an area of
   significant concern as data center growth continues to increase. This
   paper reports on an energy efficient interoperable cloud architecture
   realised as a cloud toolbox that focuses on reducing the energy

   Virtual Machine Image Constructor (VMIC), required to facilitate
   construction of energy aware cloud applications. We carry out a
   performance evaluation of the component on a cloud testbed. The results
   show the performance of Virtual Machine construction, primarily limited
   by available I/O, to be adequate for agile, energy aware software
   development. We conclude that the implementation of the VMIC is

Abstract = {{Software technology design, implementation, deployment, runtime
   verification, and experimental evaluation are of paramount importance
   for satisfying not only the functional but also the nonfunctional
   properties of distributed systems. Among the many different software
   layers in a system, the communication middleware is critical to provide
   overall efficiency and interoperability among heterogeneous systems. The
   increasing complexity of current and future distributed systems requires
   that middleware solutions be carefully designed to meet essential
   properties such as timeliness, efficiency, reliability, and scalability.
   In this paper, we describe the challenges and the role of software
   technologies and communication middleware for reliable distributed
   systems. We provide a short, non-exhaustive survey in the context of
   systems with varying non-functional requirements such as cyber-physical
   system, mobility, and cloud, with the primary objective of exposing some
   of the main challenges that these systems bring to the design and
   operation of middleware. Finally, we present a set of contributions that
   make up a new special issue on the middleware for reliable systems,
   which represent a fresh perspective on the state-of-the-art solutions
   that approach the problem of reliable software technologies and
   communication middleware from complementary view points. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Internet of Thing (IoT) has been attracting the interest of researchers
   in recent years. Traditionally, only handful types of devices had the
   capability to be connected to internet/ intranet, but due to the latest
   developments in RFID, NFC, smart sensors and communication protocols
   billions of heterogeneous devices are being connected each year. From
   smart phones uploading the data regarding location and fitness to smart
   grids uploading the data regarding energy consumption and distribution,
   these devices are generating a huge amount of data each passing moment.
   This research paper proposes a data management framework to securely
   manage the huge amount of data that is being generated by IoT enabled
   devices. The proposed framework is divided into nine layers. The
   framework incorporates layers such as data collection layer, fog
   computing layer, integrity management layer, security layer, data
   aggregation layer, data analysis layer, data storage layer, application
   layer and archiving layer. The security layer has been proposed as a
   background layer because all layers shall ensure the privacy and
   security of the data. These layers will help in managing the data from
   the point where it is generated by an IoT enabled device until the point
   where the data is archived at the data center.}},

Abstract = {{The National Flood Interoperability Experiment (NFIE) was an undertaking
   that initiated a transformation in national hydrologic forecasting by
   providing streamflow forecasts at high spatial resolution over the whole
   country. This type of large-scale, high-resolution hydrologic modeling
   requires flexible and scalable tools to handle the resulting
   computational loads. While high-throughput computing (HTC) and cloud
   computing provide an ideal resource for large-scale modeling because
   they are cost-effective and highly scalable, nevertheless, using these
   tools requires specialized training that is not always common for
   hydrologists and engineers. In an effort to facilitate the use of HTC
   resources the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project,
   CI-WATER, has developed a set of Python tools that can automate the
   tasks of provisioning and configuring an HTC environment in the cloud,
   and creating and submitting jobs to that environment. These tools are
   packaged into two Python libraries: CondorPy and TethysCluster. Together
   these libraries provide a comprehensive toolkit for accessing HTC to
   support hydrologic modeling. Two use cases are described to demonstrate
   the use of the toolkit, including a web app that was used to support the
   NFIE national-scale modeling.}},

Abstract = {{NATO and the nations use distributed simulation environments for various
   purposes, such as training, mission rehearsal, and decision support in
   acquisition processes. Consequently, modeling and simulation (M\&S) has
   become a critical technology for the coalition and its nations.
   Achieving interoperability between participating simulation systems and
   ensuring credibility of results currently often requires enormous effort
   with regards to time, personnel, and budget. Recent technical
   developments in the area of cloud computing technology and service
   oriented architecture (SOA) may offer opportunities to better utilize
   M\&S capabilities in order to satisfy NATO critical needs. A new concept
   that includes service orientation and the provision of M\&S applications
   via the as-a-service model of cloud computing may enable composable
   simulation environments that can be deployed rapidly and on-demand. This
   new concept is known as M\&S as a Service (MSaaS). There has also been
   the recent emergence of containerization as an alternative to
   virtualization. Containerization is the process of creating, packaging,
   distributing, deploying, and executing applications in a lightweight and
   standardized process execution environment known as a container. Because
   containers are, in principle, lightweight, they are suitable to serve as
   the vehicle for the provision of packaged (micro)services. Service
   orientation is an approach to the design of heterogeneous, distributed
   systems in which solution logic is structured in the form of
   interoperating services. This paper investigates various aspects of
   service orientation and containerization including simulation
   composition, networking, discovery, scalability, and overall
   performance. This investigation provides background information on the
   topics of service orientation, containerization, and Docker - a
   technology ecosystem for working with containers. A case study is
   presented for the use of Docker in support of a training simulation
   based on the high level architecture (HLA). The HLA is an IEEE standard
   architecture for distributed simulation environments that was originally
   developed for defense applications. The case study introduces a number
   of training use cases, and shows how Docker can be used to assist in
   their implementation. The performance impact of running a simulation
   within container technology is also investigated. The application of
   container technology to HLA-based simulations as presented in this paper
   is novel. The motivation for looking at this topic stems from the
   activity being conducted within NATO MSG-136.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{Cloud computing has been the enabling technology for shifting mass scale
   computation and storage requirements from individually owned clients
   towards an on-demand and utility styled alternative that provides many
   services. However, cost of maintaining datacenters, keeping the
   environmental ramifications of data centers at check, providing
   affordable computation alternative to users still needs to be addressed
   in a wholesome manner. One of the most exciting and recent research
   areas in cloud computing has been cloud federations that can mitigate
   the aforesaid problems. The past decade has seen immense efforts towards
   interoperability of clouds leading to realistic cloud federations.
   Motivated by these advancements and equipped with available
   technologies, this paper presents a detailed account of a cooperative
   cloud market. It delineates trading mechanisms of such cloud markets,
   extent of coordination among market players with illustrative examples.
   It also presents a novel two-phase coordinated resource reservation and
   provisioning (CRRP) approach that allocates cloud resources to users to
   meet the goal of minimizing users' cost. To that end, this paper
   proposes a novel Most Cost Effective Providers' Resources First (MCEPRF)
   algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been tested
   using synthetic data and the simulation results presented herein
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over its
   non-coordinated counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Software technology is constantly evolving and therefore the development
   of applications requires adapting software components and applications
   in order to be aligned to new paradigms such as Pervasive Computing,
   Cloud Computing and Internet of Things. In particular, many desktop
   software components need to be migrated to mobile technologies. This
   migration faces many challenges due to the proliferation of different
   mobile platforms. Developers usually make applications tailored for each
   type of device expending time and effort. As a result, new programming
   languages are emerging to integrate the native behaviors of the
   different platforms targeted in development projects. In this direction,
   the Haxe language allows writing mobile applications that target all
   major mobile platforms. Novel technical frameworks for information
   integration and tool interoperability such as Architecture-Driven
   Modernization (ADM) proposed by the Object Management Group (OMG) can
   help to manage a huge diversity of mobile technologies. The
   Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force (ADMTF) was formed to
   create specifications and promote industry consensus on the
   modernization of existing applications. In this work, we propose a
   migration process from C/C++ software to different mobile platforms that
   integrates ADM standards with Haxe. We exemplify the different steps of
   the process with a simple case study, the migration of ``the Set of
   Mandelbrot{''}C++ application. The proposal was validated in Eclipse
   Modeling Framework considering that some of its tools and run-time

Abstract = {{With the fast global adoption of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI),
   scientists and engineers are faced with the need to conduct
   sophisticated data analytics on large datasets to extract knowledge that
   can be used in modeling the behavior of materials. This raises a new
   problem for materials scientists: how to create and foster
   interoperability and share developed software tools and generated
   datasets. A microstructure-informed cloud-based platform (MiCloud (TM))
   has been developed that addresses this need, enabling users to easily
   access and insert microstructure informatics into computational tools
   that predict performance of engineering products by accounting for
   microstructural dependencies on manufacturing provenance. The platform
   extracts information from microstructure data by employing algorithms
   including signal processing, machine learning, pattern recognition,
   computer vision, predictive analytics, uncertainty quantification, and
   data visualization. The interoperability capabilities of MiCloud and its
   various web-based applications are demonstrated in this case study by
   analyzing Ti6AlV4 microstructure data via automatic identification of
   various features of interest and quantifying its characteristics that
   are used in extracting correlations and causations for the associated
   mechanical behavior (e.g., yield strength, cold-dwell debit, etc.). The
   data were recorded by two methods: (1) backscattered electron (BSE)
   imaging for extracting spatial and morphological information about alpha
   and beta phases and (2) electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) for
   extracting spatial, crystallographic, and morphological information
   about microtextured regions (MTRs) of the alpha phase. Extracting
   reliable knowledge from generated information requires data analytics of
   a large amount of multiscale microstructure data which necessitates the
   development of efficient algorithms (and the associated software tools)
   for data recording, analysis, and visualization. The interoperability of
   these tools and superior effectiveness of the cloud computing approach
   are validated by featuring several examples of its use in alpha/beta
   titanium alloys and Ni-based superalloys, reflecting the anticipated
   computational cost and time savings via the use of web-based
   applications in implementations of microstructure-informed integrated
   computational materials engineering (ICME).}},

Abstract = {{The move of computational genomics workflows to Cloud Computing

   Framework. RDF is advanced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to
   enable representations of linked data that are both distributed and
   discoverable. The resulting ability to decompose VCF reports of genomic
   variation without loss of context addresses the need to modularize and
   govern NGS pipelines for Precision Medicine. Specifically, it provides
   the flexibility (i.e. the indexing) needed to support the wide variety
   of clinical scenarios and patient-facing governance where only part of
   the VCF data is fitting.}},

Title = {{Edge Mesh: A New Paradigm to Enable Distributed Intelligence in Internet
   of Things}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{16441-16458}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in Internet of Things
   (IoT) from centralized cloud computing to edge computing (or fog
   computing). Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant
   increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded
   devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However,
   existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any
   decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized
   mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing.
   In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge
   Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices
   within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized
   server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh
   network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits,
   including distributed processing, lowlatency, fault tolerance, better
   scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for
   critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time
   processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an
   overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation
   behind Edge Mesh. Then, we describe in detail about the Edge Mesh
   computing paradigm, including the proposed software framework, research
   challenges, and benefits of Edge Mesh. We have also described the task
   management framework and done a preliminary study on task allocation
   problem in Edge Mesh. Different application scenarios, including smart
   home, intelligent transportation system, and healthcare, are presented
   to illustrate the significance of Edge Mesh computing paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{The explosive proliferation of smart devices and cloud computing has
   ushered the era of Cyberphysical Systems (CPS), a congruence of physical
   dynamical systems with the cyberspace. The success of deploying an
   Internet of Things (IoT) interconnecting billions of devices relies
   heavily upon making the right choices in revisiting traditional
   architectures for networked control and information processing.
   Inspired by the concept of Software Defined Systems (SDSys), we propose
   a control architecture for cyberphysical systems and discuss its
   advantages in terms of scalability, robustness, security, flexibility,
   and interoperability. The proposed architecture explicitly leverages the
   fact that agents possess computational units that may be used for
   in-network processing and decentralized control actions. We integrate a
   set of components such as sensors, actuators, access points and
   coordinators and specify the communication flow, the data flow, and the
   control flow in a programmable fashion. Control is spread over multiple
   layers (self-controllers, coordinators, local area controllers, and
   super-controllers) that form a hierarchy with added autonomy for
   distributed and decentralized actions. A middleware layer is integrated
   into the proposed design with several services and units to account for
   real-time operations in highly dynamic environments. We proceed to
   identify a wide range of potential vulnerabilities to cyberattacks at
   all levels, and propose solutions for effective resilience, detection
   and recovery. The proposed architecture aims at a holistic view with
   increased adaptability, where the controllers efficiently collaborate to
   quickly capture and respond to abnormal situations in a self-adjusting
   manner.}},

Abstract = {{Testing as a Service (TaaS) is a new business and service model that
   provides efficient and effective software quality assurance and enables
   the use of a cloud for the meeting of quality standards, requirements
   and consumer's needs. However, problems that limit the effective use of
   TaaS involve lack of standardization in writing, execution,
   configuration and management of tests and lack of portability and
   interoperability among TaaS platforms - the so-called lock-in problem.
   The lock-in problem is a serious threat to software testing in the cloud
   and may become critical when a provider decides to suddenly increase
   prices, or shows serious technical availability problems. This paper
   proposes a novel approach for solving the lock-in problem in TaaS with
   the use of design patterns. The aim to assist software engineers and
   quality control managers in building testing solutions that are both

Abstract = {{More and more companies rely on cloud services to provide their online
   software solutions. Cloud services are offered by a multitude of
   providers, each of them offering services through proprietary, mostly
   incompatible interfaces. Developing applications employing these vendor
   specific interfaces can create the ``vendor lock-in{''} problem (i.e the
   application is tightly coupled to the underlying cloud provider).
   Consequently, such applications cannot be ported without incurring
   significant costs and time delay.
   A cloud services consumer can decide to switch to a different cloud
   provider based on different criteria such as changes in business
   requirements, continuously evolving offerings from cloud providers and
   costs control. Maintaining the flexibility to change cloud providers in
   an efficient way can be a challenging task.
   We propose an efficient model-driven framework for cloud application
   portability. Our approach enables applications consuming REST resources
   in the cloud to be transferred to different cloud providers without the
   need to refactor the applications. The framework supports a wide range
   of cloud resources. The framework produces an intermediation layer which
   translates the calls between the format of the initial cloud platform
   and the new target cloud platform. The intermediation layer can be
   consumed by any programming language. We demonstrate that cloud
   application portability can be achieved. Our solution successfully maps
   cloud-based services with an overall median of 100\% for requests, and
   74.8\% for responses. Furthermore, we show that the intermediation layer
   introduces minimal additional latency.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the increase in commercial traffic, specifically in
   food industry, has a negative impact on the cost of logistics and
   environment. In other words, it has also an increased risk on quality,
   safety and food traceability. The development of traceability systems
   permits to reduce logistical risks in the food supply chains, given that
   identification, tracking and real-time monitoring in supply chains were
   always difficult tasks due to the heterogeneity of platforms and
   technologies. The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing
   has brought new approaches to collect, transfer, store and share
   information through improved cooperation and interoperability between
   logistics actors. In this work, an approach is proposed for the
   development of a food traceability system based on IoT technologies,
   cloud and fog computing to collect information and record events related
   to products anywhere in the supply chain. The goal is to satisfy users'
   requests in terms of condition, quality, and position of their products.
   Finally, a case study for a food contamination scenario is presented to
   illustrate the usefulness of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to traditional medical services provided within hospitals,
   m-Health monitoring systems (MHMSs) face more challenges in personalised
   health data processing. To achieve personalised and high-quality health
   monitoring by means of new technologies, such as mobile network and
   cloud computing, in this paper, a framework of an m-Health monitoring
   system based on a cloud computing platform (Cloud-MHMS) is designed to
   implement pervasive health monitoring. Furthermore, the modules of the
   framework, which are Cloud Storage and Multiple Tenants Access Control
   Layer, Healthcare Data Annotation Layer, and Healthcare Data Analysis
   Layer, are discussed. In the data storage layer, a multiple tenant
   access method is designed to protect patient privacy. In the data
   annotation layer, linked open data are adopted to augment health data
   interoperability semantically. In the data analysis layer, the process
   mining algorithm and similarity calculating method are implemented to
   support personalised treatment plan selection. These three modules
   cooperate to implement the core functions in the process of health
   monitoring, which are data storage, data processing, and data analysis.
   Finally, we study the application of our architecture in the monitoring
   of antimicrobial drug usage to demonstrate the usability of our method
   in personal healthcare analysis.}},

Title = {{A semantic recommendation algorithm for the PaaSport

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Platform as a service (PaaS) is one of the Cloud computing services that
   provide a computing platform in the Cloud, allowing customers to
   develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity of
   building and maintaining the infrastructure. The primary disadvantage
   for an SME to enter the emerging PaaS market is the possibility of being
   locked into a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants.
   The PaaSport project focuses on facilitating SMEs to deploy business
   applications on the best matching Cloud PaaS offering and to seamlessly
   migrate these applications on demand, via a thin, non intrusive
   Cloud-broker, in the form of a Cloud PaaS Marketplace. PaaSport enables
   PaaS provider SMEs to, roll out semantically interoperable PaaS
   offerings, by annotating them using a unified PaaS semantic model that
   has been defined as an OWL ontology. In this paper we focus on the
   recommendation algorithm that has been developed on top of the ontology,
   for providing the application developer with recommendations about the
   best-matching Cloud PaaS offering. The algorithm consists of: a) a
   matchmaking part, where the functional parameters of the application are
   taken into account to rule out inconsistent offerings, and b) a ranking
   part, where the non-functional parameters of the application are
   considered to score and rank offerings. The algorithm is extensively
   evaluated showing linear scalability to the number of offerings and
   application requirements. Furthermore, it is extensible upon future
   semantic model extensions, because it is agnostic to domain specific
   concepts and parameters, using SPARQL template queries. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The emergence of mobile healthcare systems is an important outcome of
   application of pervasive computing concepts for medical care purposes.
   These systems provide the facilities and infrastructure required for
   automatic and ubiquitous sharing of medical information. Healthcare
   systems have a dynamic structure and configuration, therefore having an
   architecture is essential for future development of these systems. The
   need for increased response rate, problem limited storage, accelerated
   processing and etc. the tendency toward creating a new generation of
   healthcare system architecture highlight the need for further focus on
   cloud-based solutions for transfer data and data processing challenges.
   Integrity and reliability of healthcare systems are of critical
   importance, as even the slightest error may put the patients' lives in
   danger; therefore acquiring a behavioral model for these systems and
   developing the tools required to model their behaviors are of
   significant importance. The high-level designs may contain some flaws,
   therefor the system must be fully examined for different scenarios and
   conditions. This paper presents a software architecture for development
   of healthcare systems based on pervasive computing concepts, and then
   models the behavior of described system. A set of solutions are then
   proposed to improve the design's qualitative characteristics including,
   availability, interoperability and performance.}},

Abstract = {{The DRM(digital rights management) techniques have been rapidly
   developed to protect the digital media contents. The growth of smart
   device and cloud computing makes the environment in which various
   services can be provided anywhere and anytime, so the DRM technologies
   have to react to such changes. From this aspect, we previously proposed
   the architecture of DRM-as-a-Service that provides various
   functionalities of DRM as some services on the cloud environment, and we
   referred to it as the DRM Cloud. In this paper, we define a reference
   model of DRM Cloud to represent some DRM functions that are provided by
   the DRM Cloud, and several service scenarios are proposed on the DRM
   Cloud. Also we simulate the DRM Cloud on the testbed and then discuss
   some security issues and how to handle the interoperability in the DRM
   Cloud. We conclude that the DRM Cloud allows the content consumers to
   use many contents with various smart devices, also let the DRM
   developers and the content service providers reduce the costs of
   development and business.}},

Abstract = {{The advancement in mobile technology and the introduction of cloud
   computing systems enable the use of educational materials on mobile
   devices for a location- and time-agnostic learning process. These
   educational materials are delivered in the form of data and
   compute-intensive multimedia-enabled learning objects. Given these
   constraints, the desired objective of mobile learning (m-learning) may
   not be achieved. Accordingly, a number of m-learning systems are being
   developed by the industry and academia to transform society into a
   pervasive educational institute. However, no guideline on the technical
   issues concerning the m-learning environment is available. In this
   study, we present a taxonomy of such technical issues that can impede
   the life cycle of multimedia-enabled m-learning applications. The
   taxonomy is devised based on the issues related to mobile device
   heterogeneity, network performance, content heterogeneity, content
   delivery, and user expectation. These issues are discussed, along with
   their causes and measures, to achieve solutions. Furthermore, we
   identify several trending areas through which the adaptability and
   acceptability of multimedia-enabled m-learning platforms can be
   increased. Finally, we discuss open challenges, such as low complexity
   encoding, data dependency, measurement and modeling, interoperability,
   and security as future research directions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cloud computing enables the on-demand delivery of resources for a
   multitude of services and gives the opportunity for small agile
   companies to compete with large industries. In the telco world, cloud
   computing is currently mostly used by mobile network operators (MNO) for
   hosting non-critical support services and selling cloud services such as
   applications and data storage. MNOs are investigating the use of cloud
   computing to deliver key telecommunication services in the access and
   core networks. Without this, MNOs lose the opportunities of both
   combining this with over-the-top (OTT) and value-added services to their
   fundamental service offerings and leveraging cost-effective commodity
   hardware. Being able to leverage cloud computing technology effectively
   for the telco world is the focus of mobile cloud networking (MCN). This
   paper presents the key results of MCN integrated project that includes
   its architecture advancements, prototype implementation, and evaluation.
   Results show the efficiency and the simplicity that a MNO can deploy and
   manage the complete service lifecycle of fully cloudified, composed
   services that combine OTT/IT-and mobile-network-based services running
   on commodity hardware. The extensive performance evaluation of MCN using
   two key proof-of-concept scenarios that compose together many services
   to deliver novel converged elastic, on-demand mobile-based but
   innovative OTT services proves the feasibility of such fully virtualized
   deployments. Results show that it is beneficial to extend cloud
   computing to telco usage and run fully cloudified mobile-network-based
   systems with clear advantages and new service opportunities for MNOs and
   end-users.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) adopts and extends the concept of cloud
   computing to make mass Manufacturing Resources and Capabilities (MR/Cs)
   more widely integrated and accessible to users through the Internet.
   However, a single manufacturing cloud (MC) has limited MR/Cs, due to
   both economic and technical constraints, and can only provide limited
   manufacturing services in terms of function, price, and reliability,
   etc. Using the aggregated MR/Cs or services of multiple MCs is a natural
   evolution, i.e., MCs can satisfy peak demands for MR/Cs through
   collaboration, while users can have a wider selection of services from
   multiple MCs. To address such requirements, we propose a hybrid
   framework for integrating multiple MCs. The key functional modules and
   the business models of the proposed framework are presented to guide
   future integration of MCs. The enabling technologies, such as semantic
   web and ontologies, intelligent agents, service-oriented architecture,
   and materials handling and logistics technologies are also discussed. A
   case study is given, showing the feasibility and rationality of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In recent times the world has seen an exponential rise in the number of
   devices connected to the internet. This widespread expansion of the
   internet and growth in the number of interconnected devices has lead to
   the rise of many new age technologies. Internet of Things (IoT) being
   one of them allows devices to communicate with one another that are
   connected through the internet. It provides a new way of looking towards
   pervasive computing wherein ``things{''} be it sensors, embedded
   devices, actuators or humans interact with one another. But currently
   IoT is facing a number of challenges related to scalability,
   interoperability, storage capacity, processing power and security which
   all act as a deterrent for its practical implementation. Cloud
   computing, the buzzword of the IT industry, suits best to handle all
   these challenges, thus leading towards the integration of cloud and IoT.
   In this paper, we present a layered architecture for Cloud of Things,
   i.e. the amalgamation of cloud computing and internet of things. The
   architecture provides a scalable approach for IoT as it allows dynamic
   addition of n-number of ``things{''}. Moreover, the architecture allows
   the end users to host their applications onto the cloud and access IoT
   systems remotely. Towards the end, the paper discusses a use case that
   proves the correctness of the proposed architecture.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The cloud computing paradigm as originally conceived has reached a
   plateau of evolution, exposing several limitations that compromise the
   main features of the paradigm: resource contention, interruption of
   services, lack of interoperability in data representation, quality of
   service degradation, and others. Consequently, several new approaches to
   its use and optimization have been implemented to maintain continuity of
   technology. In this way, multiple clouds organizations have been formed
   with the objective of maximizing the use of cloud computing, in
   particular small-and medium-sized cloud providers who present
   difficulties to maintain all properties of the paradigm have mobilized
   themselves into organizations to maximize their revenues. Such
   organizations, formally called inter-clouds, have been gaining
   attention, where solutions like hybrid clouds, multi-clouds, and cloud
   federations are the main elements in the academic-scientific and
   industrial world. In particular, cloud federations are well behaved
   because organizations governed by a contract can be interesting and
   useful in many critical environments. However, there is a lack of works
   dedicated only to clouds federations. In addition, the existing works
   are not able to describe federations as unique inter-cloud entities to
   highlight specific properties and characteristics. In this paper, we
   present the desired functional and non-functional properties for cloud
   federations through the identification of the main architectures in the
   literature and we evaluate these architectures based on the described
   properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the beginning of the e-commerce era, retailers mostly adopted
   vertically integrated solutions to control the entire e-commerce value
   chain. However, they began to realize that to achieve agility, a better
   approach would be to focus on certain core capabilities and then create
   a partner ecosystem around them. From a technical point of view, this
   means it is advised to have a lightweight platform architecture with
   small core e-commerce functionality which can be extended by additional
   services from third party providers. In a typical e-commerce ecosystem
   with diverse information systems of network partners, integration and
   interoperability become critical factors to enable seamless coordination
   among the partners. Furthermore an increasing adoption of cloud
   computing technology could be observed resulting in more challenging
   integration scenarios involving cloud services. Thus, an e-commerce
   platform is required that suites the advanced needs for flexible and
   agile service integration. Therefore, this paper aims to present a
   reference architecture of a novel pluggable service platform for
   e-commerce. We investigate on currently available online shop platform
   solutions and integration platforms in the market. Based on the findings
   and motivated by literature on service-oriented design, we develop an
   architecture of a service-based pluggable platform for online retailers.
   This design is then instantiated by means of a prototype for an
   e-commerce returns handling scenario to demonstrate the feasibility of
   our architecture design.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years, because of the attractive advantages given by
   Cloud providers to consumers, many companies outsource their data or
   Information Technology (IT) system to the Cloud based technology. Many
   Internet protocols for service access standards exist and are used to
   ensure communication between user's browser and Web server, such as
   Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol
   (SOAP). The most of Cloud providers use REST as an interface Web service
   because of its advantages in the Web environment. Contrariwise the SOAP
   Web service is used in several areas such as education and industrial
   fields. These client areas had a limited choice of Cloud provider that
   can respond to their needs, because the number of Cloud providers using
   SOAP Web service is restricted and each service has its specific
   characteristics. As a solution, we propose a Cloud SaaS middleware based
   on two interfaces and an internal component. This Cloud enables
   communication between Cloud consumer using SOAP Web service and Cloud
   provider using REST Web service. This is to achieve benefits such as
   standardization and interoperability and minimizing lock-in of Cloud
   providers. This paper motivates Cloud SaaS architectures and presents
   the architecture of the Cloud service standardization.}},

Abstract = {{In a cloud computing paradigm, energy efficient allocation of different
   virtualized ICT resources (servers, storage disks, and networks, and the
   like) is a complex problem due to the presence of heterogeneous
   application (e.g., content delivery networks, MapReduce, web
   applications, and the like) workloads having contentious allocation
   requirements in terms of ICT resource capacities (e.g., network
   bandwidth, processing speed, response time, etc.). Several recent papers
   have tried to address the issue of improving energy efficiency in
   allocating cloud resources to applications with varying degree of
   success. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no published
   literature on this subject that clearly articulates the research problem
   and provides research taxonomy for succinct classification of existing
   techniques. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to identify open
   challenges associated with energy efficient resource allocation. In this
   regard, the study, first, outlines the problem and existing hardware and
   software-based techniques available for this purpose. Furthermore,
   available techniques already presented in the literature are summarized
   based on the energy-efficient research dimension taxonomy. The
   advantages and disadvantages of the existing techniques are
   comprehensively analyzed against the proposed research dimension
   taxonomy namely: resource adaption policy, objective function,
   allocation method, allocation operation, and interoperability.}},

Abstract = {{Media content in its digital form has been rapidly scaling up, resulting
   in popularity gain of cloud computing. Cloud computing makes it easy to
   manage the vastly increasing digital content. Moreover, additional
   features like, omnipresent access, further service creation, discovery
   of services, and resource management also play an important role in this
   regard. The forthcoming era is interoperability of multiple clouds,
   known as cloud federation or inter-cloud computing. With cloud
   federation, services would be provided through two or more clouds. Once
   matured and standardized, inter-cloud computing is supposed to provide
   services which would be more scalable, better managed, and efficient.
   Such tasks are provided through a middleware entity called cloud broker.
   A broker is responsible for reserving resources, managing them,
   discovering services according to customer's demands, Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) negotiation, and match-making between the involved
   service provider and the customer. So far existing studies discuss
   brokerage in a narrow focused way. In the research outcome presented in
   this paper, we provide a holistic brokerage model to manage on-demand
   and advance service reservation, pricing, and reimbursement. A unique
   feature of this study is that we have considered dynamic management of
   customer's characteristics and historical record in evaluating the
   economics related factors. Additionally, a mechanism of incentive and
   penalties is provided, which helps in trust build-up for the customers
   and service providers, prevention of resource underutilization, and
   profit gain for the involved entities. For practical implications, the
   framework is modeled on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) On-Demand and
   Reserved Instances service pricing. For certain features required in the
   model, data was gathered from Google Cluster trace.}},

Abstract = {{Background: New community-based arrangements and novel technologies can
   empower individuals to be active participants in their health
   maintenance, enabling people to control and self-regulate their health
   and wellness and make better health-and lifestyle-related decisions.
   Mobile sensing technology and health systems responsive to individual
   profiles combined with cloud computing can expand innovation for new
   types of interoperable services that are consumer-oriented and
   community-based. This could fuel a paradigm shift in the way health care
   can be, or should be, provided and received, while lessening the burden
   on exhausted health and social care systems.
   Objective: Our goal is to identify and discuss the main scientific and
   engineering challenges that need to be successfully addressed in
   delivering state-of-the-art, ubiquitous eHealth and mHealth services,
   including citizen-centered wellness management services, and reposition
   their role and potential within a broader context of diverse
   sociotechnical drivers, agents, and stakeholders.
   Methods: We review the state-of-the-art relevant to the development and
   implementation of eHealth and mHealth services in critical domains. We
   identify and discuss scientific, engineering, and implementation-related
   challenges that need to be overcome to move research, development, and
   the market forward.
   Results: Several important advances have been identified in the fields
   of systems for personalized health monitoring, such as smartphone
   platforms and intelligent ubiquitous services. Sensors embedded in
   smartphones and clothes are making the unobtrusive recognition of
   physical activity, behavior, and lifestyle possible, and thus the
   deployment of platforms for health assistance and citizen empowerment.
   Similarly, significant advances are observed in the domain of
   infrastructure supporting services. Still, many technical problems
   remain to be solved, combined with no less challenging issues related to
   security, privacy, trust, and organizational dynamics.
   Conclusions: Delivering innovative ubiquitous eHealth and mHealth
   services, including citizen-centered wellness and lifestyle management
   services, goes well beyond the development of technical solutions. For
   the large-scale information and communication technology-supported
   adoption of healthier lifestyles to take place, crucial innovations are
   needed in the process of making and deploying usable empowering end-user
   services that are trusted and user-acceptable. Such innovations require
   multidomain, multilevel, transdisciplinary work, grounded in theory but
   driven by citizens' and health care professionals' needs, expectations,
   and capabilities and matched by business ability to bring innovation to
   the market.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new paradigm, based on an extension of the Open Cloud
   Computing Interface (OCCI), for the on demand monitoring of the cloud
   resources provided to a user. We have extended the OCCI with two new
   subtypes of core entities: one to collect the measurements and the other
   to process them. The user can request instances of such entities to
   implement a.monitoring infrastructure.
   The paradigm does not target a specific cloud model, and is therefore
   applicable to any kind of resource provided as a service. The
   specifications include only the minimum needed to describe a monitoring
   infrastructure, thus making this standard extension simple and easily
   adoptable. Despite its simplicity, the model is able to describe complex
   solutions, including private/public clouds, and covers both
   infrastructure and application monitoring. To highlight the impact of
   our proposal in practice, we have designed an engine that deploys a
   monitoring infrastructure using its OCCI-compliant descriptions. The
   design is implemented in a prototype that is available as open source.

   migration: a business perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Vendor lock-in is a major barrier to the adoption of cloud computing,
   due to the lack of standardization. Current solutions and efforts
   tackling the vendor lock-in problem are predominantly
   technology-oriented. Limited studies exist to analyse and highlight the
   complexity of vendor lock-in problem in the cloud environment.
   Consequently, most customers are unaware of proprietary standards which
   inhibit interoperability and portability of applications when taking
   services from vendors. This paper provides a critical analysis of the
   vendor lock-in problem, from a business perspective. A survey based on
   qualitative and quantitative approaches conducted in this study has
   identified the main risk factors that give rise to lock-in situations.
   The analysis of our survey of 114 participants shows that, as computing
   resources migrate from on-premise to the cloud, the vendor lock-in
   problem is exacerbated. Furthermore, the findings exemplify the
   importance of interoperability, portability and standards in cloud
   computing. A number of strategies are proposed on how to avoid and
   mitigate lock-in risks when migrating to cloud computing. The strategies
   relate to contracts, selection of vendors that support standardised
   formats and protocols regarding standard data structures and APIs,
   developing awareness of commonalities and dependencies among cloud-based
   solutions. We strongly believe that the implementation of these
   strategies has a great potential to reduce the risks of vendor lock-in.}},

Abstract = {{The expanding use of cloud computing is driving a growth in the amount
   of data traffic carried by wide area networks (WANs). Software-defined
   networking (SDN) is potentially capable of handling this growth
   efficiently while offering new services. SDN makes networks more
   flexible, leading to more timely service implementation and more
   efficient network operation. Such timely service implementation should
   enhance network value. Although SDN has already been applied to networks
   within data centers, it has not yet been applied to WANs. This is
   because WANs support social infrastructure, which demands strict quality
   and functionality, among other requirements. However, the application of
   SDN to WANs would promote open source platforms, which would help
   eliminate vendor lock-in and support market expansion through open
   innovation. This paper first describes the challenges inherent in the
   application of SDN to WANs, presents Fujitsu's SDN solution for WANs,
   and introduces Fujitsu's projects related to WAN control technology and

Abstract = {{Interoperability remains a significant burden to the developers of
   Internet of Things systems. This is because resources and APIs are
   dynamically composed; they are highly heterogeneous in terms of their
   underlying communication technologies, protocols and data formats, and
   interoperability tools remain limited to enforcing standards-based
   approaches. In this paper, we propose model-based engineering methods to
   reduce the development effort towards ensuring that complex software
   systems interoperate with one another. Lightweight interoperability
   models can be specified in order to monitor and test the execution of
   running software so that interoperability problems can be quickly
   identified, and solutions put in place. A graphical model editor and
   testing tool are also presented to highlight how a visual model improves
   upon textual specifications. We show using case-studies from the FIWARE
   Future Internet Service domain that the software framework can support
   non-expert developers to address interoperability challenges.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the usability of Future Internet technologies
   (aka ``Generic Enablers of the Future Internet{''}) in the context of
   environmental applications. The paper incorporates the best aspects of
   the state-of-the-art in environmental informatics with geospatial
   solutions and scalable processing capabilities of Internet-based tools.
   It specifically targets the promotion of the ``Environmental Observation
   Web{''} as an observation-centric paradigm for building the next
   generation of environmental applications. In the Environmental
   Observation Web, the great majority of data are considered as
   observations. These can be generated from sensors (hardware), numerical
   simulations (models), as well as by humans (human sensors).
   Independently from the observation provenance and application scope,
   data can be represented and processed in a standardised way in order to
   understand environmental processes and their interdependencies. The
   development of cross-domain applications is then leveraged by
   technologies such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data
   Processing and Analytics. For example, ``the cloud{''} can satisfy the
   peak-performance needs of applications which may occasionally use large
   amounts of processing power at a fraction of the price of a dedicated
   server farm. The paper also addresses the need for Specific Enablers
   that connect mainstream Future Internet capabilities with sensor and
   geospatial technologies. Main categories of such Specific Enablers are
   described with an overall architectural approach for developing
   environmental applications and exemplar use cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{A case study in open source innovation: developing the Tidepool Platform

Abstract = {{Objective Develop a device-agnostic cloud platform to host diabetes
   device data and catalyze an ecosystem of software innovation for type 1
   diabetes (T1D) management.
   Materials and Methods An interdisciplinary team decided to establish a
   nonprofit company, Tidepool, and build open-source software.
   Results Through a user-centered design process, the authors created a
   software platform, the Tidepool Platform, to upload and host T1D device
   data in an integrated, device-agnostic fashion, as well as an
   application ({''}app{''}), Blip, to visualize the data. Tidepool's
   software utilizes the principles of modular components, modern web
   design including REST APIs and JavaScript, cloud computing, agile
   development methodology, and robust privacy and security.
   Discussion By consolidating the currently scattered and siloed T1D
   device data ecosystem into one open platform, Tidepool can improve
   access to the data and enable new possibilities and efficiencies in T1D
   clinical care and research. The Tidepool Platform decouples diabetes
   apps from diabetes devices, allowing software developers to build
   innovative apps without requiring them to design a unique back-end
   (e.g., database and security) or unique ways of ingesting device data.
   It allows people with T1D to choose to use any preferred app regardless
   of which device(s) they use.
   Conclusion The authors believe that the Tidepool Platform can solve two
   current problems in the T1D device landscape: 1) limited access to T1D
   device data and 2) poor interoperability of data from different devices.
   If proven effective, Tidepool's open source, cloud model for health data
   interoperability is applicable to other healthcare use cases.}},

Abstract = {{Successful deployment of Electronic Health Record helps improve patient
   safety and quality of care, but it has the prerequisite of
   interoperability between Health Information Exchange at different
   hospitals. The Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) developed by HL7 is
   a core document standard to ensure such interoperability, and
   propagation of this document format is critical for interoperability.
   Unfortunately, hospitals are reluctant to adopt interoperable HIS due to
   its deployment cost except for in a handful countries. A problem arises
   even when more hospitals start using the CDA document format because the
   data scattered in different documents are hard to manage. In this paper,
   we describe our CDA document generation and integration Open API service
   based on cloud computing, through which hospitals are enabled to
   conveniently generate CDA documents without having to purchase
   proprietary software. Our CDA document integration system integrates
   multiple CDA documents per patient into a single CDA document and
   physicians and patients can browse the clinical data in chronological
   order. Our system of CDA document generation and integration is based on
   cloud computing and the service is offered in Open API. Developers using
   different platforms thus can use our system to enhance interoperability.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, administrators and practitioners want to speed up task
   processes, as decision-making and application periods in business life
   have been decreasing. As a result of this demand, accessing data
   clusters outdoors is now a necessity. Space and time dependency for
   accessing data has been reduced with the help of information
   technologies. Recently, a new technology called cloud computing (CC) has
   been developed to store and share the data under an Internet
   infrastructure. From a traditional viewpoint, editing, analysing and
   sharing spatial data have been made by way of a geographical information
   system (GIS). When technology developers harmonised CC and GIS, a new
   technological era called spatial cloud computing (SCC) or cloud GIS
   emerged. SCC is an efficient tool that is used for refining GIS
   applications and also delivering a comprehensive service for local
   governments. CC presents new important research eras in terms of
   development of GIS technology. The aim of this work was to determine the
   technical and practical problems in the process of moving towards SCC in
   Turkey and to prepare `would-be' solutions for local government
   organisations. Some interoperability models for integrating spatial
   datasets were developed and tested with sample datasets.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The proliferation of Cloud Computing platforms has led to the emergence
   of a large number of heterogeneous platform resources, services,
   application programming interfaces and supported frameworks and
   technologies. On one hand, supported frameworks vary from one
   Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to another depending on their
   implementations and capacities. On the other hand, each PaaS provides a
   specific and proprietary scenario to provision adequate resources and to
   deploy applications. In this paper, we propose a new PaaS-independent
   approach to provision in a unified way, appropriate PaaS resources for
   applications deployment in Cloud platforms. Our approach aims at
   addressing vendor lock-in restrictions and applications portability
   issues in existing Cloud platforms. To that end, we define a unified
   description model based on the Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI)
   core model that allows describing and managing an abstract Cloud
   resource. Our defined model consists of two main parts: (1) an OCCI
   platform extension which describes PaaS resources that can be
   provisioned by a PaaS to set-up an appropriate environment and (2) an
   OCCI application extension which describes application resources to
   deploy an application in this environment. We show the feasibility of
   our approach with an implementation and a use case of a realistic
   deployment scenario in Cloud Foundry PaaS.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing in conjunction with recent advances in Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPSs) unravels new opportunities for the European manufacturing
   industry for high value-added products that can quickly reach the market
   for sale. The Internet of Things joins the Internet of Services to enact
   the fourth industrial revolution that digitalises the manufacturing
   techniques and logistics while pushing forward the development of
   improved factories with machine-to-machine communication delivering
   massively customised products tailored to the individualised needs of
   the customer. Interconnected CPSs using internal and
   cross-organizational services cooperate in real time increase the
   business agility and flexibility of manufacturing companies. Using CPS
   with cloud computing architectures leverage data and services stored and
   run in cloud environment from different vendors that usually offer
   different service interfaces to share their services and data. However,
   when using such architectures data silos appear and different vendors
   having different service interfaces can easily result in vendor lock-in
   issues. This paper proposes a multi-cloud marketplace architecture
   leveraging the existing myriad of different cloud environments at
   different abstraction levels including the Infrastructure-, Platform-,
   and Software-asa-Service cloud models-that is, Everything as a Service
   or XaaS-delivering services and with different properties that can
   control the computation happening in multiple cloud environments sharing
   resources with each other.}},

Abstract = {{Every industry is adopting Cloud Computing platform due to its low cost
   services and zero overheads of maintenance and upgrades. Several new
   issues are generated because of this wide adoption which are concern to
   both cloud service provider and cloud service users. Cloud service
   providers are facing the issue of resource limitations. Cloud service
   users are facing the issue of vendor lock-in. Federated Cloud through
   brokering can be used to solve the above mentioned issues. Cloud
   Federation is the place where cloud service providers can gather to
   share their resources and the cloud service consumers can buy those
   resources. The federation is either handled by one of the cloud service
   provider or a third party known as cloud service broker. The broker is
   solely responsible for providing services to the cloud consumers which
   are leased by cloud service providers. In this paper, we are proposing a
   framework for federated cloud based on the broker.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is on the hype nowadays, new offering appears frequently
   and the demand on cloud services is growing in an exponential rate. In
   such dynamic and competitive market, working in silos is not a
   successful strategy. Therefore, single providers should integrate their
   resources and move up to a new level of cooperation and interconnection.
   This federation would bring in added value in terms of QoS, security,
   economics, etc. but also more complexity regarding federation management
   and how interoperability between disparate providers would be
   established. In this paper, we will present our federation concept
   through a layered autonomous intercloud reference architecture driven by

Abstract = {{This conceptual paper aims to bring the fusion of emerging technologies
   and available data in order to gain insights and use them efficiently at
   the time of natural crisis. The global displacement scale due to
   disasters between 2008 and 2014 stands at an alarming rate of over 25
   million lives on an average. Chennai floods 2015 has been the trigger
   for us to visualize the disaster management issue in various dimensions
   and come up with an approach by leveraging emerging technologies which
   has the potential to disseminate alerts seamlessly. The objective is to
   put forth some ideas on utilizing the existing information databases and
   signals from prevailing alert systems and integrate it using emerging
   technologies by leveraging the power of digital forces such as Mobility,
   Social media and Analytics. The proposed conceptual architecture could
   get data of various types and alerts in real time, process data streams
   and group them based on metadata and alert appropriate stakeholders.
   This proposed conceptual system based on the secondary research
   highlights how the benefits could be taken to various stakeholders such
   as government authorities, volunteers, media, residents of the disaster
   prone area and local authorities in those areas. The digital forces such
   as mobility, cloud computing, analytics and social media are fast
   emerging and the computing resources are available at a much lower costs
   almost like a commodity. This paper also leaves room for futuristic
   research in the IT technologies and their interoperability, performing
   analytics on the available inputs at the time of crisis and maximize the
   benefit to society and also emphasizes on smart integrated communication
   using cutting edge IT technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces DEVS Distributed Modeling Framework (DEVS-DMF), a
   publicly available implementation of DEVS for integrating simulation
   models as parallel and distributed microservices suitable for
   containerization and automated deployment. Based on the Parallel DEVS
   framework, DEVS-DMF explicitly enables asynchronous execution of
   distributed models via the actor model of computation. It is optimized
   for interoperability of models and flexibility of deployment, as opposed
   to performance. The DEVS-DMF framework provides two simplifying benefits
   to the simulation developer. It encapsulates internal state and
   synchronizes simulation execution to free the developer to focus on
   designing the flow of messages and encoding the state transitions and
   outputs generated by their flow. It also provides a natural model for
   partitioning the simulation into local processes, because each DEVS
   model, as an actor, performs a unit of execution on a separate thread
   each time it handles a message. An additional advantage of this
   framework is location transparency, its flexibility to deploy actors in
   a single Java Virtual Machine to scale up, or to deploy actors to
   different containers in the cloud to scale out. Two simulation
   implementations of DEVS-DMF include a parallel simulation test case and
   a combat weapons simulator that assesses the performance of alternative
   small arms weapons designs.}},

Abstract = {{The integration Internet of Things (IoT) generally identical with Cloud
   computing. IoT aims to connect the heterogeneous objects/devices with
   each other, in order to communicate or exchange data/information.
   Development of the Cloud IoT system, have challenges to achieve these
   objectives, such as middleware, interoperability and scalability of
   system. In this paper, we will discuss the solution of the challenges,
   by applying the publish and subscriber method, using MQTT protocol. This
   paper, proposed of architecture model design, which is implemented in
   the form of system topology. This topology apply to monitor and control
   the provision of nutrition hydroponics, accessible as a Cloud SaaS. From
   the test results, average node response time needed to connect and
   communicate with IoT Cloud system (online) is 7.21 seconds. The time
   required to declare offline state of a node is 21.55 seconds. The test
   results of Cloud IoT (broker), obtained that number of nodes for each
   level QoS, affecting resource usage of CPU and throughput. The highest
   resource usage of CPU is 19\% of 2.0GHz and throughput TX/RX is
   34.68KBps/49.4KBps. This result obtained from 1000 nodes scheme testing
   with 1 messages/node, by using simulation application, on QoS level 2.
   The average of minimum bandwidth used is +/- 0.90Kbps by 1 publisher, to
   send 1 message with 115 Bytes of payload size, on each 3 levels of QoS
   MQTT, and approximately +/- 0.04Kbps on subscriber to receive that

Abstract = {{Various forms of cloud computing principles and technologies are
   becoming important recently. This paper addresses cloud computing for
   automation and control applications. It's argued that the open Internet
   cloud idea has such limitations that its not appropriate for automation.
   Since automation is physically and geographically local, it is
   inevitable to introduce the concept of local automation clouds. It's
   here proposed that local automation clouds should be self contained an
   be able to execute the intended automation functionalities without any
   external resources. Thus providing a fence at the rim of the local cloud
   preventing any inbound or outbound communication. Such a local cloud
   provides possibilities to address key requirements of both todays and
   future automation solutions. Adding mechanisms for secure inter-cloud
   administration and data tranfere enables local automation cloud to meet
   IoT automation system requirements as: 1) Interoperability of a wide
   range of IoT and legacy devices 2) Automation requirement on latency
   guarantee/prediction for communication and control computations. 3)
   Scalability of automation systems enabling very large integrated
   automation systems 4) Security and related safety of automation systems
   5) Ease of application engineering 6) Multi stakeholder integration and
   operations agility.
   How these requirements can be met in such a local automation cloud is
   discussed with references to proposed solutions. The local automation
   cloud concept is further verified for a compartment climate control
   application. The control application included an IoT controller, four
   IoT sensors and actuators, and a physical layer communication gateway.
   The gateway acted as host for local cloud core functionalities. The
   climate control application has successfully been implemented using the
   open source Arrowhead Framework and its supports for design and
   implementation of self contained local automation clouds.}},

Abstract = {{Provisioning cloud applications usually is a complex task as it involves
   the deployment and configuration of several components (e.g., load
   balancer, application server, database) and cloud services (computing,
   storage, CDN, etc.) also known as application blueprints or topologies.
   The Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications
   (TOSCA) is a recent standard that has focused on standardizing the way
   cloud applications are structured and managed to favor interoperability.
   In this paper we describe an approach that facilitates the evaluation of
   different application topologies by enabling cloud users to easily
   provision and evaluate different TOSCA topology options based on
   performance and cost metrics. We show the technical feasibility of the
   approach based on a case study with the WordPress blogging application
   where various topologies were automatically provisioned and evaluated in
   order to gain insights into the best (w.r.t. performance) options.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of Cloud Computing, organizations are increasingly
   migrating their information and communication technology (ICT) resources
   to the cloud. This has recently gained a great attention because of
   cloud pay-as-you-go model which drastically reduces actual IT
   infrastructure with high performance and continuous availability. In
   order to effectively utilize existing cloud resources, organizations may
   look for available cloud resources from different cloud providers.
   However, cloud resources are heterogeneous and described by different
   standards which prevents an easy and dynamic interoperability between
   organizations. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework tackling
   this heterogeneity issue. We develop a set of ontologies to semantically
   represent cloud resources by looking at three cloud resource description
   standards: Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud
   Applications (TOSCA), Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), and Cloud
   Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI). Hence, our framework
   promotes the creation of a common semantic knowledge base of cloud
   resources described using these different standards. This knowledge base
   allows a seamless translation of cloud providers' resource descriptions.
   We developed an application to validate our approach as a proof of
   concept. We also evaluated the feasibility and completeness of our
   semantic framework on use cases obtained from standard specifications.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity in the way different cloud providers offer their services,
   give their SLAs, present their QoS, support different technologies,
   etc., complicates the portability and interoperability of cloud
   applications, and favors vendor lockin. Standards like TOSCA, and tools
   supporting them, have come to help in the provider-independent
   description of cloud applications. After the variety of proposed
   cross-cloud application management tools, we propose going one step
   further in the unification of cloud services with a deployment tool in
   which IaaS and PaaS services are integrated into a unified interface. We
   provide support for applications whose components are to be deployed on
   different providers, indistinctly using IaaS and PaaS services. The
   TOSCA standard is used to define a portable model describing the
   topology of the cloud applications and the required resources in an
   agnostic, and providers-and resources-independent way. We include in
   this paper some highlights on our implementation on Apache Brooklyn and
   present a non-trivial example that illustrates our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Current PaaS platforms enable single or hybrid cloud deployments.
   However, such deployment types cannot best cover the user application
   requirements as they do not consider the great variety of services
   offered by different cloud providers and the effects of vendor lock-in.
   On the other hand, multi-cloud deployment enables selecting the best
   possible service among equivalent ones providing the best trade-off
   between performance and cost. In addition, it avoids cases of service
   level deterioration due to service under-performance as main effects of
   vendor lock-in. While many multi-cloud application deployment research
   prototypes have been proposed, such prototypes do not examine the effect
   that deployment decisions have on application performance. As such, they
   blindly attempt to satisfy low-level hardware requirements by neglecting
   the impact of allocation decisions on higher-level requirements at the
   component or application level. To this end, this paper proposes a new
   IaaS selection algorithm which, apart from being able to satisfy both
   low and high level requirements of different types, it also exploits
   deployment knowledge offered via reasoning over previous application
   execution histories to take the best possible allocation decisions. The
   experimental evaluation clearly shows that by considering this extra
   knowledge, more optimal deployment solutions are derived, able to
   maintain the service levels requested by users, in less solving time.}},

Abstract = {{Through the development and accessibility of the Internet, nowadays the
   cloud computing has become a very popular. This concept has the
   potential to change the use of information technologies. Cloud computing
   is the technology that provides infrastructure, platform or software as
   a service via the network to a huge number of remote users. The main
   benefit of cloud computing is the utilization of elastic resources and
   virtualization. Two main properties are required from clouds by users:
   interoperability and privacy. This article focuses on interoperability.
   Nowadays it is difficult to migrate an application between clouds
   offered by different providers. The article deals with that problem in
   multicloud environment. Specifically, it focuses on the application
   performance optimization in a multicloud environment. A new method is
   suggested based on the state of the art. The method is divided into
   three parts: multicloud architecture, method of a horizontal
   scalability, and taxonomy for multicriteria optimization. The principles
   of the method were applied in a design of multicriteria optimization
   architecture, which we verified experimentally. The aim of our
   experiment is carried on a portal offering a platform according to the

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has enabled various product lifecycle management (PLM)
   systems from different parts venders to form a heterogeneous system to
   facilitate joint product development. To avoid the performance issue
   caused by traversal multiple different PLM systems in hierarchical
   comparison, in this research we have developed an efficient hierarchical
   comparison mechanism for cloud-based heterogeneous PLM systems. We have
   used this mechanism to convert the traditional hierarchical comparison
   by traversal through the tree type data structure into a string
   comparison. Our approach is very simple but scalable, and also very
   suited to the cloud-based heterogeneous PLM system because the method
   itself is independent to the details of data stores. Therefore we have
   offered an efficient solution for a specific interoperability problem in
   cloud-based heterogeneous product lifecycle management systems.}},

Abstract = {{Due to low level of penetration of ICT in SME sector, Indian SMEs are
   deprived of benefits like improved efficiency, better market linkages
   and enhanced customer services. Cloud computing has the potential to
   accelerate ICT adoption among SMEs, by making ICT accessible to the
   small businesses without incurring much costs and efforts. Cloud
   computing can prove to be very beneficial to SMEs. Flexible cost
   structure and delivery of computing services through internet can make
   cloud computing a unique proposition for SMEs. Other features such as
   scalability, flexibility and easy deployment process provide an
   opportunity for small businesses to get access to the most advanced \&
   latest technologies at affordable cost. However, issues like lack of
   knowledge/awareness about cloud computing, poor internet connectivity,
   security \& privacy concerns, lack of trust, and vendor lock-in prevent
   small businesses from adopting cloud computing. In spite of these
   concerns, cloud computing can still prove to be commercially viable
   option to SMEs. The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate key
   factors influencing SME's intention to adopt cloud computing in Himachal
   Pradesh, India. Findings of this work are intended to provide valuable
   insights for practitioners and researchers who are interested in
   spreading the usage \& adoption of cloud computing among SMEs.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing model has been among the main stream popular new
   technologies by providing services such as software, platform and
   infrastructure. In the process of providing better services for
   customers, cloud service providers have developed proprietary standards
   on how cloud application interacts with their cloud. This has been
   limiting the cloud adoption because of the vendor lock-in and
   portability issues. The need for the business application on clouds to
   be interoperable is increasing. The cloud federation would be the
   solution in providing on demand resources and better scalability. The
   IEEE cloud computing working standard groups have certain standards to
   build interoperable cloud environment. The paper explores the approach
   for cloud federation by using standard protocols by implementing IEEE
   standards as a proof of concept using multiple OpenStack environment,
   which can be easily extended to other clouds (AWS, Azure, VMware) and
   finally conclude with benefits of using standards based federation.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing providers offer diverse services and capabilities, which
   can be used by end-users to compose heterogeneous contexts of multiple
   cloud platforms to deploy their applications, in accordance with the
   best offered capabilities. However, this is an ideal scenario, since
   cloud platforms are being conducted in an isolated way by presenting
   interoperability and portability restrictions. Each provider defines its
   own API, non-functional requirements, QoS, add-ons, etc., and developers
   are often locked-in a concrete cloud environment, hampering the
   integration of heterogeneous provider services to achieve
   cross-deployment. This work presents an approach to deploy cross-cloud
   applications by using standardisation efforts of design, management and
   deployment of cloud applications. Specifically, using mechanisms
   specified by the TOSCA and CAMP standards, we propose a methodology to
   describe the topology and distribution of modules of a cloud application
   and to deploy the inter-connected modules over heterogeneous clouds. We
   present our prototype TOMAT, which supports the automatic distribution
   of cloud applications over multiple providers.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing is increasingly used as the platform for IT
   infrastructure provisioning, application/systems development and end
   user support of a wide range of core services and applications for
   businesses and organisations. Cloud Computing is drastically changing
   the way IT is delivered and used. However, many challenges remain to be
   tackled. Concerns such as security, vendor lock-in, interoperability and
   accessibility are examples of issues that need to be addressed.
   Standards and certification programs play an important role in terms of
   increasing the market confidence in Cloud Computing. The availability of
   Cloud Computing standards and certification schemes that address current
   concerns will ensure that both customers/users as well as providers are
   likely to regard Cloud Computing with the same level of reliability,
   trust and maturity as traditional IT. In February 2015, the Cloud
   Standards Coordination Phase 2 (CSC-2) was launched by ETSI to address
   issues left open after the initial Cloud Standards Coordination work was
   completed at the end of 2013. CSC-2 is investigating some specific
   aspects of the Cloud Computing Standardization landscape, in particular
   from the point of view of the Cloud Computing users (e.g., SMEs,
   Administrations). In this paper, we will present final results of the

Abstract = {{Today, IoT systems are designed and implemented to address specific
   challenges based on domain specific requirements, thus not taking into
   consideration issues of openness, scalability, interoperability and
   use-case independence. As a result, they are less principled, lacking
   standards, vendor oriented and hardly replicable since the same IoT
   architecture cannot be used in more than one use-cases. To address the
   fragmentation of existing IoT solutions, the IoT-A project proposes an
   architecture reference model that defines the principles and standards
   for generating IoT architectures and promoting the interoperation of IoT
   solutions. However, IoT-A addresses the architecture design problem, and
   does not focus on whether existing cloud platforms can offer the tools
   and services to support the implementation of IoT-A compliant IoT
   systems. In this work we propose an architecture based on IoT-A that
   focuses on the FIWARE open cloud platform that in turn provides the
   building blocks of future Internet applications and services. We further
   correlate FIWARE and IoT-A projects to identify the key features for
   FIWARE to support IoT-A compliant system implementations.}},

Abstract = {{One of the benefits of OCCI stems from simplifying the life of
   developers aiming to integrate multiple cloud managers. It provides them
   with a single protocol to abstract the differences between cloud service
   implementations used on sites run by different providers. This comes
   particularly handy in federated clouds, such as the EGI Federated Cloud
   Platform, which bring together providers who run different cloud
   management platforms on their sites: most notably OpenNebula, OpenStack,
   or Synnefo. Thanks to the wealth of approaches and tools now available
   to developers of virtual resource management solutions, different paths
   may be chosen, ranging from a small-scale use of an existing command
   line client or single-user graphical interface, to libraries ready for
   integration with large workload management frameworks and job submission
   portals relied on by large science communities across Europe. From lone
   wolves in the long-tail of science to virtual organizations counting
   thousands of users, OCCI simplifies their life through standardization,
   unification, and simplification. Hence cloud applications based on OCCI
   can focus on user specifications, saving cost and reaching a robust
   development life-cycle. To demonstrate this, the paper shows several EGI
   Federated Cloud experiences, demonstrating the possible approaches and
   design principles.}},

   multitier cloud enables the end-to-end orchestration of resources from
   sensor/actuator to smart edge and to core massive datacenter. The SDI
   provides the necessary heterogeneous resources, including computing,
   storage, GPUs, programmable hardware, sensors and networking, that are
   all managed jointly within a single domain or across multiple domains
   through federation. The data dissemination services allow individuals,
   organizations, and public agencies to share real-time or historical data
   within a domain or across domains. The analytics services provide
   intelligence by acting on data in support of decision-making. Public and
   private application providers use these services to create smart city
   applications. We discuss our experience implementing and operating a
   Canada-wide multitier SDI cloud and a Greater Toronto Area (GTA)
   platform for smart transportation, and we present extensions of these
   platforms to handle smart city applications across multiple domains.
   Throughout we describe how the proposed smart city platform supports
   extensibility and smartness, and how it has the desired attributes of
   replicability, scalability and interoperability.}},

Abstract = {{The application of information and communications technology to support
   urban operational decision makers has received vast interest from
   industry and academia. This has helped to mature several fields of
   research within the smart city domain, such as the internet of things,
   cybernetics, and informatics. However, these fields of research remain
   siloed, which leads to a clear gap in the literature.
   The paper recognizes the mentioned gap manifesting in a new smart urban
   area in Wales, UK, and presents a platform which intends to demonstrate
   the benefits of exploiting the synergies between these fields of
   research. Following consultation with various stakeholders at the pilot
   site, the platform utilizes advanced sensing, analytics,
   interoperability, and visualization components to provide valuable
   human-machine interactions to facility managers in the district.
   Delivering this high value knowledge in a timely, engaging, and
   accessible manner through advanced decision support interfaces. The
   paper presents the platform's software architecture, before discussing
   the decision support interface, intelligent web services, and
   interoperability components in more detail. The solution's key
   contributions beyond existing internet of things platforms are the use
   of a 3D game engine, machine learning and optimization web services, and
   the integration across the knowledge value chain. This knowledge
   integration is achieved through semantic modelling of the buildings,
   urban environment, socio-technical systems, and smart devices in the
   district.}},

Abstract = {{Healthcare using Mobile devices and Cloud Computing is an emergent topic
   of interest in both industry and research. Though ubiquity of mobile
   devices and availability of e-Health record plays an important role to
   enhance health care quality and services, it introduces several
   challenges too such as, limited power of mobile devices, privacy and
   anonymity of patient data, the reliability of end user, interoperability
   and availability of e-Health records, etc. Under HIPAA regulations,
   healthcare data needs to be secured from unsolicited disclosure when
   sharing among multiple medical service providers. In this paper, we
   focus on exchanging healthcare data among doctor and patient's
   healthcare service providers. We develop an android mobile application
   and a Cloud service to exchange patient's data among authorized users in
   a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The cloud service that we
   developed performs cryptographic computations, communicates with mobile
   application and also overcomes the limitations of mobile devices. We
   evaluate our proposed solution using real-world data set. The
   performance analysis proves the efficiency of our application. Privacy
   analysis of our proposed solution depicts that our system is secure and
   protects the privacy of healthcare data.}},

Abstract = {{Any information system using encryption tends to have its own key
   management infrastructure. In practice, we find a separate key
   management systems dedicated to application encryption, or database
   encryption, or file encryption etc. This emergent needs to several key
   management systems and multiple cryptographic algorithms are resolved by
   the new Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP). This work
   specifies how the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) can be
   included in Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol in order to provide
   additional security features, flexibility, interoperability and
   authentication specially in distributed systems like Cloud Computing.
   Till now, authentication in TLS is limited to digital certificate and
   Kerberos. In this paper, we use the Key Management Interoperability
   Protocol to make an additional authentication option for TLS and we
   reduce handshake latency to 0-RTT for repeated handshakes and 1-RTT for
   full handshakes. We specify also the KMIP-TLS extension and its formal
   validation with AVISPA tool.}},

Abstract = {{Today's competitive environment pushes technology into changing quickly,
   hence triggering organizations to be ready for such changes. Cloud
   computing is one of the popular evolving information technologies that
   seems to affect organizations in different ways, and on different
   levels. The academic as well as the professional literature focused on
   identifying the several promoters and inhibitors for adopting cloud
   solutions. However, the related work does not clearly identify how
   adopting such solutions affects the organization's IT governance, where
   implementing effective IT governance is required in order to survive in
   a competitive market. Therefore, the aim of this research paper is to
   study the effect of cloud solutions on organizations' IT governance. We
   first built this paper through an exhaustive literature review
   describing the various cloud computing promoters and inhibitors, along
   with the organizational transformations cited by several researchers.
   Then, in order to validate these transformations and the effects brought
   by the cloud, we conducted a set of twenty interviews with professionals
   (CIOs, CEOs, and project managers) from large organizations in France.
   Our findings endorse the most common elements found in the literature
   regarding the important considerations when adopting the cloud
   (security, reversibility, interoperability, etc.) New findings have also
   been highlighted in our data analysis; cloud computing seems to affect
   the technological and strategical aspects of IT governance, as well as
   the business transformation.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has transformed the accessibility and usage of
   information technology resources, by offering them as services via the
   Internet. Cloud service provisioning spans across infrastructure,
   platform and software levels. The management of the services at these
   levels is based on monitoring. The analysis of monitoring data provides
   insight into Cloud operations in order to make informed decisions. Due
   to the emergence of numerous heterogenous Cloud platforms with
   proprietary APIs, service and monitoring data are being formatted using
   diverse and mostly incompatible data interchange formats. This results
   to interoperability issues and makes the analysis of monitoring data
   from multi-Cloud service deployments difficult to handle. The existing
   research efforts on data interchange formats have been mainly focused on
   general performance analyses. Little or no effort has been channelled
   towards a combination of multiple data interchange formats based on data
   type to achieve efficient serialisation that can facilitate
   interoperability in federated Clouds, and also reduce the size of data
   and bandwidth utilisation cost. This paper addresses these issues by
   presenting automated framework that is capable of automatically
   selecting the most suitable data interchange formats for achieving an
   efficient formatting and serialisation outcome. The goal of the
   framework is to enable robust and transparent communication within and
   between multiple Cloud deployments. Based on three use case scenarios,
   we evaluate the proposed framework to demonstrate its efficacy in
   formatting and serialising data.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is based on Virtual Machines (VM) or containers, which
   provide their own software execution environment that can be deployed by
   facilitating technologies on top of various physical hardware. The use
   of VMs or containers represents an efficient way to automatize the
   overall software engineering and operation life-cycle. Some of the
   benefits include elasticity and high scalability, which increases the
   utilization efficiency and decreases the operational costs. VMs or
   containers as software artifacts are created using provider-specific
   templates and are stored in proprietary or public repositories for
   further use. However, technology specific choices may reduce their
   portability, lead to a vendor lock-in, particularly when applications
   need to run in federated Clouds.
   In this paper we present the current state of development of the novel
   concept of a VM repository and operational environment for federated
   Clouds named ENTICE. The ENTICE environment has been designed to receive
   unmodified and functionally complete VM images from its users, and
   transparently tailor and optimise them for specific Cloud
   infrastructures with respect to their size, configuration, and
   geographical distribution, such that they are loaded, delivered, and
   executed faster and with improved QoS compared to their current
   behaviour. Furthermore, in this work a specific use case scenario for
   the ENTICE environment has been provided and the underlying novel
   technologies have been presented.}},

Abstract = {{Current IaaS cloud providers typically adopt different underlying cloud
   infrastructures and are reluctant to provide consistent interfaces to
   facilitate cross-cloud interoperability. Such status quo significantly
   complicates inter-cloud virtual machine relocation and impedes the
   adoption of cloud services for more enterprises and individual users. In
   this paper, we propose vMocity, a middleware framework enabling VM
   relocation across heterogeneous IaaS clouds. vMocity extends the
   principles of cold migration and decouples VM's storage stack from their
   underlying virtualization platforms, which presents a homogeneous view
   of storage to cloud users. We deploy our prototype system across three
   representative commercial cloud platforms - Amazon EC2, Google Compute
   Engine, and VMware vSphere-based private cloud. Compared to existing
   approaches on both synthetic and real-world workloads, vMocity can
   significantly reduce the disruption time, up to 27 times shorter, of
   relocated services and boost the recovery time, up to 1.8 times faster,
   to pre-relocation performance level. Our results demonstrate that
   vMocity is efficient and convenient for relocating VMs across clouds,
   offering freedom of choice to customers when facing a market of IaaS
   clouds to align with business objectives (cost, performance, service
   availability, etc.)}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is becoming increasingly popular. Information technology
   market leaders, e.g., Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, are extensively
   shifting toward cloud-based solutions. However, there is isolation in
   the cloud implementations provided by the cloud vendors. Limited
   interoperability can cause one user to adhere to a single cloud
   provider; thus, a required migration of an application or data from one
   cloud provider to another may necessitate a significant effort and/or
   full-cycle redevelopment to fit the new provider's standards and
   implementation. The ability to move from one cloud vendor to another
   would be a step toward advancing cloud computing interoperability and
   increasing customer trust. This study proposes a cloud broker solution
   to fill the interoperability gap between different software-as-a-service
   providers. The proposed cloud broker was implemented and tested on a
   real enterprise application dataset. The migration process was completed
   and it worked correctly, according to a specified mapping model.}},

   inter-cloud ecosystem is started to be required as a necessary

   dominators. To fill this gap, after surveying the maturity of open
   technologies and current state of adoption of the openness from cloud
   providers, this paper presents ICCM: Inter-Cloud Concern Model, a
   reference architecture to model the concerns of interoperable cloud

Abstract = {{The cloud computing paradigm has changed the way of managing identity.
   Domain based identity management systems are no more suitable. The
   alternative of a universal identifier globally handled by an all knowing
   identity provider proved its failure. The best opproach is to follow the
   cloud paradigm by offering an Identity as a Service layer. Many projects
   and standards were proposed to reach this goal but the lack of
   interoperability and the increasing number of digital identities have
   hampered the task. We propose in this work an Identity as a Service
   framework based on the Automated IDentity Finder (AIDF) system which
   associates one service provider or more with the suitable identity
   provider after user consent, thus enabling Single Sign On. Additional
   functionalities are claims transform between different standards and
   semantic mapping among heterogenous attributes in the same identity
   context.}},

Abstract = {{With clouds becoming a standard target for deploying applications, it is
   more important than ever to be able to seamlessly utilize resources and
   services from multiple providers. Proprietary vendor APIs make this
   challenging and lead to conditional code being written to accommodate
   various API differences, requiring application authors to deal with
   these complexities and to test their applications against each supported
   cloud. In this paper, we describe an open source Python library called
   CloudBridge that provides a simple, uniform, and extensible API for
   multiple clouds. The library defines a standard `contract' that all
   supported providers must implement, and an extensive suite of
   conformance tests to ensure that any exposed behavior is uniform across
   cloud providers, thus allowing applications to confidently utilize any
   of the supported clouds without any cloud-specific code or testing.}},

Abstract = {{In today's scenario when snore and more enterprises are shifting towards
   cloud computing, the variety volume and velocity of the cloud is
   expected to cope up to the expectations. Although big data centers and
   latest technologies have handled huge volumes of data but still the
   problem of integrating heterogeneous data on the cloud persists. This
   paper proposes a model for integrating heterogeneous data on the cloud
   focusing on the security of data at rest. The model is based on service
   oriented computing, as services are based on fundamental pastures of
   interoperability and loose coupling. The different layers of the
   proposed model deal with different aspects of data interpretation on
   cloud. The client layer provides interface to the client and works on
   basic request and response parameters. The service inventory layer
   comprises of different services working on integration and encryption of
   data and the cloud data layer holds the actual data in uniform format.
   The paper aims to provide a solution to the heterogeneous data
   integration problem on cloud and data security at rest.}},

Abstract = {{In the Semantic Web of Things (SWoT), different type of sensors will
   collect a large number of real-time data and heterogeneous information.
   How to deal with these data and provide support for decision-making is a
   problem. Cloud Computing mode is particularly suitable for handling the
   large data sets. It has recently emerged as a new paradigm for providing
   various services over the Internet. However, in order to provide better
   services to consumers, cloud providers have to establish partnerships
   with others, and they often use non-standard formats. So
   interoperability issues exist in cloud computing environments. In this
   paper, we analysis existing interoperability challenges. After that we
   formulate an Ontology based Cloud Service Broker and the semantic
   technology is the key catalyst to support the broker. Moreover,
   interoperability is determined at the data level as well as the service
   level. It is an important issue to discuss how to represent the cloud
   resources and services. We build upon the current state-of-the-art cloud
   ontologies to provide formally represented and then achieving
   interoperability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a cloud-based cyber infrastructure for the
   management of information involved in bridge monitoring applications.
   Recent years have seen an emergence and increasing use of sensor
   technologies for bridge monitoring. In addition to the measurement data
   from the sensors, bridge monitoring and management systems require many
   different types of information including bridge geometries, engineering
   analytical models and the metadata about the sensors. In this study, we
   employ cloud computing services and have implemented a cloud-based cyber
   infrastructure platform to effectively manage the information involved
   in bridge monitoring applications. Furthermore, NoSQL database systems
   are deployed for scalable and flexible data storage. To facilitate
   interoperability, a bridge information model is designed based on open
   standards and bridge engineering analysis and design tools. For
   demonstration purposes, the model of the Telegraph Road Bridge located
   in Michigan and the sensor data collected on the bridge are employed to
   illustrate the use of the cyber infrastructure system for bridge
   monitoring.}},

   principal source for computing resources to a fully fledged alternative

   as a Service facilitates the hosting of scalable applications in the

   environments. Although most offerings are conceptually comparable to
   each other, the interfaces for application deployment and management
   vary greatly between vendors. Despite providing similar functionalities,
   technically different workflows and commands provoke vendor lock-in and
   hinder portability as well as interoperability. To that end, we present
   a unified interface for application deployment and management among
   cloud platforms. We validate our proposal with a reference

   Nowadays to achieve their cloud goals, organizations are increasingly
   move towards enabling multi-cloud environments which promised to support
   very large-scale, worldwide, distributed applications using multiple and
   independent cloud environments. However, given their complexity and
   distribution, multi-cloud has to face several key challenges around

   these challenges increase the needs of security governance in such

   processing and storage so that resource intensive applications can also
   be executed and a large amount of data can be stored on resource

   of cloud service and resource may take place. In this sense, Semantic
   Web Technologies, holding a great potential to cloud computing, have
   been proven as an efficient means to relive these challenges. This paper
   examines and explores the role of Semantic Web Technologies in the cloud
   from a wide variety of literatures. Various approaches, architectures,
   and frameworks are screened and evaluated based on eight prime research
   questions. At the end of the review, research opportunities in the form
   of a roadmap are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of cloud computing has enabled powerful virtualization
   capabilities and outsourcing strategies. Suitably, a vast variety of
   cloud resource configuration and management tools have emerged to meet
   this needs, whereby DevOps are empowered to design end-to-end and
   automated cloud management tasks that span across a selection of
   best-of-breed tools. However, inherent heterogeneities among resource
   description models and management capabilities of such tools pose
   fundamental limitations when managing complex and dynamic cloud
   resources. In this paper we thus propose the notion of ``Domain-specific
   Models{''} a higher-level model-driven approach for describing
   elementary and federated cloud resources as reusable knowledge artifacts
   over existing tools. We also propose a pluggable architecture to
   translate these artifacts into lower-level resource descriptions and
   management rules. This paper describes concepts, techniques and a
   prototypical implementation. Experiments on real-world federated cloud
   resources display significant improvements in productivity. As well as
   notably enhanced usability achieved by our approach in comparison to
   traditional techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Medical devices, generally, have been unique units, so that a typical
   hospital room in an intensive care ward hosts a big number of
   stand-alone devices, each one with its own user interface. Nowadays,
   these devices have some connection mechanisms, but the goal is to go
   beyond the simple connectivity that permits only the reading of the
   measured value on a computer monitor, to move towards a more complex
   device integration that offers the possibility to stream device data
   directly into patient electronic records, to create a database for
   further statistical investigations and to integrate the information
   derived from multiple medical devices into a single display. In this
   paper, we propose a method to connect and integrate into a cloud-based
   infrastructure the bilirubinometer, which is a typical Neonatal
   Intensive Care Unit biomedical device that measures the amount of
   bilirubin in infants' blood, which is symptomatic of neonatal jaundice.
   After data extraction process from the instrument, the database is
   normalised according to a record format defined in XML language. Then,
   through Web Services of importation, data is transferred to the cloud
   database. It enables online sharing of encrypted healthcare data,
   reported in a standard language to allow a complete interoperability as
   well as a total security of shared data. Our proposed infrastructure
   allows the communication between different medical devices of a Neonatal
   Intensive Care Unit and permits the automation of the process of device
   data collection, transmission, storage, processing and availability for
   medical staff.}},

Abstract = {{Governments and healthcare providers are under increasing pressure to
   streamline their processes for efficiency, to reduce operational costs
   while improving service delivery and quality of care. Systematic
   performance management of healthcare processes is important in
   determining if quality of care goals are being met at all levels of the
   healthcare ecosystem. The challenge is that reaching these goals
   requires the aggregation and analysis of large amounts of data from
   various stakeholders in the healthcare industry. With the lack of
   interoperability between stakeholders in current healthcare compute and
   storage infrastructure as well as the volume of data involved, our
   ability to measure quality of care across the healthcare system is
   either limited or non-existent. Cloud computing is an emerging
   technology that can provide the needed interoperability and management
   of large volumes of data across the entire healthcare system. In this
   paper, we review various cloud computing applications for surveillance
   and performance management of quality of care in healthcare. We also
   introduce a framework for achieving systematic surveillance and
   performance management across the entire healthcare system. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{In 2013, in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the
   European Commission promoted a major initiative addressing cloud
   computing and the public sector, named Cloud-for-Europe (C4E),, for the
   creation of a digital single market of IT services in the cloud. That
   initiative pushes public sector organizations from Member States for
   preparing themselves in procuring secure, cost-effective, reliable and
   trustworthy cloud services. C4E has adopted the Pre-Commercial
   Procurement (PCP) instrument for involving not only public sector
   entities but also IT, Telcos, and SMEs in providing innovative
   cloud-based solutions that best fit public sector's needs. In this
   paper, after presenting a brief overview of C4E initiative and the
   current European scenario for public cloud services and cloud projects,
   we discuss the lessons learned on the relevance of achieving
   cross-border interoperability between public cloud computing services,
   deriving from our successful participation at the first PCP phase as

Abstract = {{In this work we introduce the EUBrazilCC federated cloud
   e-infrastructure based on Fogbow, a new middleware designed to support
   federation of IaaS cloud providers according to a novel approach. It is
   based on the provision of federation functionalities offered at a higher
   architectural level than current approaches by being deployed on top of
   the IaaS cloud orchestrators of each federation member. Fogbow is
   endowed with great flexibility due to the use of plugins that allow for
   the definition of precise interaction points between the federation
   middleware and the underlying cloud orchestrator. The resulting
   architecture, which relies on standards for conciliating different
   orchestrators' peculiarities, is thereby able to provide a common API to
   decouple federation functionalities from the orchestrator
   functionalities. Fogbow has been deployed to federate the private clouds
   of the members of the consortium of the EUBrazilCC project, and is also
   being used in an experimental federation that is part of the cloud
   initiative of the Brazilian National Research and Education Network
   (NREN) operator, as well as in an experimental deployment that aims at
   federating private clouds belonging to two large public companies in

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) has advanced in different directions,
   including the development of new architectures, platforms and
   applications. This multidirectional progress has resulted in the
   creation of several parallel IoT ecosystems called verticals. Therefore,
   several approaches have proposed solutions for interoperability of these
   ecosystems through the delivery of services over virtual infrastructure
   (Cloud Computing). We introduce the paradigm of Fog of Things (FoT) and
   propose the design and development of a self-organizing platform called
   SOFT-IoT: Self-Organizing Fog of Things. SOFT-IoT implements the ``Fog
   Computing{''} concept introduced by CISCO for the Internet of Things,
   where part of data processing capacity and service delivery operations
   are processed locally in ``small servers{''}, i. e., close to where data
   is collected. SOFT-IoT deals with protocols to facilitate the local
   computing processing and rely in more complex operations running in
   virtual entities avoiding the traditional approach of centralized cloud
   computing solutions. In this way, SOFT-IoT enables interoperability of
   local ecosystems in the fog and also at the cloud level, where other
   data is stored, processed and complex operations are resolved. In other
   words, in SOFT-IoT the data processing and delivery of services occurs
   locally in order to overcome with current infrastructure limitations and
   data processing alleviating those demands for heavy computational
   resources that can occur in remote servers, i. e., geographically away
   from where data is generated.}},

Abstract = {{The capability to operate cloud-native applications can generate
   enormous business growth and value. But enterprise architects should be
   aware that cloud-native applications are vulnerable to vendor lock-in.
   We investigated cloud-native application design principles, public cloud
   service providers, and industrial cloud standards. All results indicate
   that most cloud service categories seem to foster vendor lock-in
   situations which might be especially problematic for enterprise
   architectures. This might sound disillusioning at first. However, we
   present a reference model for cloud-native applications that relies only
   on a small subset of well standardized IaaS services. The reference
   model can be used for codifying cloud technologies. It can guide
   technology identification, classification, adoption, research and
   development processes for cloud-native application and for vendor
   lock-in aware enterprise architecture engineering methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{A Number of Dynamics such as on-demand and versatile cloud services,
   software interoperability standards, high bandwidth dynamic
   communication technologies, broad network access, virtualization
   technology, privacy and security measures made cloud computing so
   popular, where as Security is a key inhibitor to the cloud. In this
   paper we discussed different risks, threats and attacks. We focused on
   Advanced Persistent Threat which is stealthy, targeted and data focused,
   progressive defense system is designed and Implemented along with
   mathematical analysis concerned with networks and algorithms. A
   self-destructive and Constructive mechanism is adopted using bilinear
   mapping and reverse engineering methods. Prime issues for cloud
   securities such as Confidentiality and Authentication are discussed. A
   Practical and Computational Approach is designed and implemented using
   cryptography concepts such as Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption
   and ElGamal encryption and fuzzy logic system based on Advanced
   Intelligence system through a mathematical transformation and finally
   conceptual analysis is given.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, one of the hottest topics in the Internet. of Things (IoT)
   research domain regards the issue to overcome the heterogeneity of
   proprietary technologies and systems so as to enable the integration of
   applications and devices developed for different environments in a
   single interoperable framework. Towards this objective, virtualization
   is widely used to foster integration and creation of new services and
   applications. Similar benefits are expected by its application in the
   smart grid arena. The use of a virtualization middleware is expected to
   enrich the capabilities and opportunities related to the use of smart
   grid devices. In this paper, we propose key features for an
   interoperable, re-usable, elastic and secure smart grid architecture
   which is cloud-based and relies on REST APIs. To highlight the benefits,
   a practical case study is presented, where outlined functionalities are
   implemented in a cloud-based loT platform. The advantages brought by the
   proposed middleware in terms of interoperability, re-usability, privacy
   and elasticity of the underlying infrastructure are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The vendor lock-in has been a major problem since cloud computing has
   evolved as on the one hand side hinders a quick transition between cloud
   providers and at the other hand side hinders an application deployment
   over various clouds at the same time (cross-cloud deployment). While the
   rise of cross-cloud deployment tools has to some extend limited the
   impact of vendor lock-in and given more freedom to operators, the fact
   that applications now are spread out over more than one cloud platform
   tremendously complicates matters: Either the operator has to interact
   with the interfaces of various cloud providers or he has to apply custom
   management tools. This is particularly true when it comes to the task of
   auto-scaling an application and adapting it to load changes. This paper
   introduces a novel approach to monitoring and adaptation management that
   is able to flexibly gather various monitoring data from virtual machines
   distributed across cloud providers, to dynamically aggregate the data in
   the cheapest possible manner, and finally, to evaluate the processed
   data in order to adapt the application according to user-defined rules.}},

Abstract = {{High availability and disaster recovery (HADR) are often discussed in
   highly critical business systems for business function recovery and
   continuity concerns. With the development of cloud computing, virtual
   cloud services are perfectly matched to HADR scenarios, and
   interoperability is a significant aspect to help users to use HADR
   service across different cloud platforms and providers. In this paper,
   we present an architectural pattern describing the integration of high
   availability and disaster recovery. We focus on database cluster
   replication between private cloud and public cloud environments. This
   HADR pattern for database cluster replication implements both
   synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently for high
   availability and disaster recovery purposes. To evaluate the
   effectiveness of this pattern, we simulate a MySQL-database-cluster HADR
   scenario under three strategies: hot standby, warm standby and cold
   standby, and analyze the performance, business continuity features and
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in Cloud computing technology provide capabilities
   for an extensible, reliable, effective and dynamic infrastructure to
   technology-enabled enterprises, in order to efficiently leverage (or
   even monetize) their on-premise equipment. Furthermore, the
   virtualization technologies powering the Cloud revolution expand their
   reach by the day, and are nowadays commonly available, nearly household,
   capabilities. In this light, the intersection between volunteering and
   Cloud computing may bring massive and ubiquitous compute power for IaaS
   users. For instance, scientists and researchers, as a category of very
   demanding users, may benefit from such an enlargement of the pool of
   resources to tap into for high complexity computational workloads and
   big data problems without concern for the setup and maintenance of the
   underlying infrastructure. We have investigated this concept in the past
   under the Cloud@Home project, aimed at implementing a desktop-powered
   Cloud. In this paper we propose a blueprint of a Cloud@Home
   implementation starting from OpenStack, a well-known platform for Cloud
   solutions, a de-facto standard with variety of features, high
   interoperability and Open Source support. The reference, layered
   architecture and the preliminary implementation of a Cloud@Home

Abstract = {{The emergence of complex cloud services and the growing number of QoS
   metrics entail the need of automation to transform business requirements
   into QoS constraints. Furthermore, in the emergent context of Cloud
   Federations providers need to share knowledge to improve
   interoperability when negotiating SLA (Service Level Agreements).
   Intelligent software agents are capable of supporting activities related
   to SLA negotiation, as well as sharing knowledge into large-scale
   distributed environments. Since they are usually provided with different
   ontologies, understanding the meaning of the messages requires the
   availability of common, global ontologies among customers and providers.
   In order to deal with this issue, we discuss a multi-agent SLA
   negotiation protocol which does not need a common global agent ontology.
   The protocol takes into account different concerns related to the
   understanding of semantic and technical terms, and the knowledge about
   the agent abilities on semantic and technical terms are shared among the
   Cloud Federation.}},

Abstract = {{Outsourcing enterprises' data, business processes and applications to
   the Cloud is emerging as a major trend thanks to the Cloud offerings and
   features. Basically, enterprises expect when outsourcing to save cost,
   improve software and hardware performance and gain more flexibility by
   responding to the dynamic customers' requirements. However, adopting the
   Cloud as an alternative environment for the management of the business
   processes leads to a radical change in the enterprise IT infrastructure.
   Furthermore, additional challenges may appear such as data security,
   vendor-lock-in and labor union rendering the outsourcing decision
   require a deep analysis and knowledge about the business processes
   context. Assisting enterprises' experts in the business process
   outsourcing to the Cloud decision is the focus of this paper: it extends
   the BPMN 2.0 language to explicitly support the specification of
   outsourcing concepts, and it presents an automated approach to help
   decision makers identify those parts of their business process that
   benefit most from outsourcing to the Cloud. Using this extension helps
   also in identifying Cloud services considered as the most suitable to
   support the outsourced business process requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Web services play vital role in the development of emerging
   technologies such as Cloud computing and Internet of Things. Although,
   there is a close relationship among the discovery, selection and
   composition tasks of Web services, research community has treated these
   challenges at individual level rather to focus on them collectively for
   developing efficient solution, which is the purpose of this work. This
   paper aims to propose an approach to integrate the service discovery,
   selection and composition of Semantic Web services on runtime basis.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach defined as a quality
   of service (QoS)-aware approach is based on QoS model to perform
   discovery, selection and composition tasks at runtime to enhance the
   user satisfaction and quality guarantee by incorporating non-functional
   parameters such as response time and throughput with the Web services
   and user request. In this paper, the proposed approach is based on
   ontology for semantic description of Web services, which provides
   interoperability and automation in the Web services tasks.
   Findings - This work proposed an integrated framework of Web service
   discovery, selection and composition which supports end user to search,
   select and compose the Web services at runtime using semantic
   description and non-functional requirements. The proposed approach is
   evaluated by various data sets from the Web Service Challenge 2009
   (WSC-2009) to show the efficiency of this work. A use case scenario of
   Healthcare Information System is implemented using proposed work to
   demonstrate the usability and requirement the proposed approach.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper is to develop an
   integrated approach of Semantic Web services discovery, selection and
   composition by using the non-functional requirements.}},

Abstract = {{With the explosive growth of digital data communications in synergistic
   operating networks and cloud computing service, hyperconnected
   manufacturing collaboration systems face the challenges of extracting,
   processing, and analyzing data from multiple distributed web sources.
   Although semantic web technologies provide the solution to web data
   interoperability by storing the semantic web standard in relational
   databases for processing and analyzing of web-accessible heterogeneous
   digital data, web data storage and retrieval via the predefined schema
   of relational / SQL databases has become increasingly inefficient with
   the advent of big data. In response to this problem, the Hadoop
   Ecosystem System is being adopted to reduce the complexity of moving
   data to and from the big data cloud platform. This paper proposes a
   novel approach in a set of the Hadoop tools for information integration
   and interoperability across hyperconnected manufacturing collaboration
   systems. In the Hadoop approach, data is ``Extracted{''} from the web
   sources, ``Loaded{''} into a set of the NoSQL Hadoop Database (HBase)
   tables, and then ``Transformed{''} and integrated into the desired
   format model with Hive's schema-on-read. A case study was conducted to
   illustrate that the Hadoop Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) approach for the
   syntax and semantics web data integration could be adopted across the
   global smartphone value chain. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Desktop cloud paradigm arises from combining cloud computing with
   volunteer computing systems in order to harvest the idle computational
   resources of volunteers' computers Students usually underuse university
   computer rooms. As a result, a desktop cloud can be seen as a form of
   high performance computing (HPC) at a low cost. When the capacity of a
   desktop cloud is insufficient to execute a HPC project, a new
   opportunity for collaborative work among universities appears, resulting
   in a federation of desktop cloud systems to create a significant amount
   of virtual resources from multiple providers on non-dedicated
   infrastructure. Even though cloud federation generates research activity
   today, neither interoperability among several implementations of cloud
   computing nor the federation of desktop clouds are resolved issues.
   Therefore, our initiative is related to gathering the existing and idle
   computer resources provided by the universities that take part to form a
   cloud federation on non-dedicated infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an information repository to support bridge
   monitoring applications on a cloud computing platform. Bridge
   monitoring, with instrumentation of sensors in particular, collects
   significant amount of data. In addition to sensor data, a wide variety
   of information such as bridge geometry, analysis model and sensor
   description need to be stored. Data management plays an important role
   to facilitate data utilization and data sharing. While bridge
   information modeling (BrIM) technologies and standards have been
   proposed and they provide a means to enable integration and facilitate
   interoperability, current BrIM standards support mostly the information
   about bridge geometry. In this study, we extend the BrIM schema to
   include analysis models and sensor information. Specifically, using the
   OpenBrIM standards as the base, we draw on CSI Bridge, a commercial
   software widely used for bridge analysis and design, and SensorML, a
   standard schema for sensor definition, to define the data entities
   necessary for bridge monitoring applications. NoSQL database systems are
   employed for data repository. Cloud service infrastructure is deployed
   to enhance scalability, flexibility and accessibility of the data
   management system. The data model and systems are tested using the
   bridge model and the sensor data collected at the Telegraph Road Bridge,
   Monroe, Michigan.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability is a global concern. It must be addressed by different
   sectors of society, even by the information technology sector. Moreover,
   such effort should not be only focused on direct impacts of technology
   over the environment, but also on the software engineering discipline by
   itself, which is facing now other dimensions of sustainability. In this
   paper, an adaptation of the Attribute-Driven Design method including
   sustainability as a driver is introduced. The proposal is based on
   sustainability guidelines established by the Karlskrona Manifesto. It
   involves a multidimensional sustainability analysis considering three
   levels of impacts and opportunities for each one of the architectural
   components. The adaptation is motivated by the design of a sustainable
   architecture of a cloud-based personal health record. The designed
   architecture is termed Health Catalogue Repository. It offers cloud
   services, allowing interoperability and timely access to patients'
   clinical information. Energy consumption and resources optimization are
   contemplated like fundamental sustainability characteristics in the
   architectural design. The achieved design offers a better trade-off
   among quality attributes and sustainability constraints. The achieved
   design by using the proposal reduces the long-term impacts whilst
   increases the sustainability opportunities in architectural components.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of the IT world is currently shifting to cloud platforms,
   and this calls for a greater measure of security for clouds. The
   emphasis for security originates from the need to transfer data across

   transferred information. This data is encrypted and decrypted using keys
   and is managed by Key Lifecycle Managers (KLMs) which communicate using
   a standardized protocol. Thus, to provide end user flexibility which
   helps in choosing the most reliable KLM, it is essential for cloud
   platforms to provide support for a standardized protocol so as to allow

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has the potential to speed up IT adoption among SMEs in
   developing economies. Though the benefits of cloud computing is very
   appealing, the level of cloud adoption is still low among SMEs. This
   research aims to identify the key enablers, barriers and other factors
   that influence cloud adoption among SMEs in Tamil Nadu by conducting
   empirical investigations. We have used TOE framework to identify and
   capture the factors that affect technology adoption. We highlight cost
   benefits of using cloud infrastructure, scalability and agility of cloud
   services as the key enablers of cloud adoption. Broadband availability,
   high bandwidth cost and vendor lock-in are the main barrier for cloud
   adoption. Compatibility to existing system, complexity of the migration
   process, top management support, government policies and competitor
   pressure are the major organizational factors affecting cloud adoption
   among SMEs in Tamil Nadu. This study is part of a larger study which
   aims to develop a cloud migration decision support system (CMDSS) for
   SMEs in Tamil Nadu.}},

Title = {{Understanding the impact of cloud-based services adoption on
   organizational flexibility An exploratory study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{566-588}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that drive
   the adoption of cloud-based services and further understand the impact
   of this adoption on the organizational flexibility. This study presents
   information technology executive's perspective and discovers new
   constructs of organizational flexibility that can be achieved due to the
   adoption of cloud-based services, which is the main contribution of this
   paper.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses in-depth interview
   approach. Total 21 Indian cases were studied by interacting with
   respondents having similar profiles (i.e. CIOs, CTOs, technology heads,
   and systems managers). Based on the literature review a semi-structured
   questionnaire was prepared and administered through in-depth interviews.
   Findings - Analysis of data reveals that cloud-based services provide
   relative advantage in terms of scalability, accessibility, and on-demand
   deployment of services within no time. Easy to use interface,
   experience, and expertise of the cloud service provider as well as
   support from top management plays important role in the cloud adoption
   decision. Further the study also identifies that no matter which model
   of cloud-based services (software-as-a-service (SaaS),
   platform-as-a-service (PaaS), or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)) is
   used; cloud-based services' adoption impacts organizational flexibility,
   which can be divided into four categories, namely, economic flexibility,
   process flexibility, performance flexibility, and market flexibility.
   Research limitations/implications - This is an exploratory study
   conducted through in-depth interviews hence the results can further be
   verified through a quantitative research. The study does not explore
   negative factors that may discourage adoption of cloud-based services.
   Though two factors vendor lock-in and security emerged as a concern very
   prominently in the in-depth interviews but this issue can further be
   explored in detail.
   Originality/value - This study bridge the gap in the research by
   identifying the factors that drive the adoption of cloud-based services
   in different forms (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS) as well exploring the impact
   of cloud adoption on the organizational flexibility in case of Indian
   organizations.}},

Abstract = {{The challenge of service distribution has been considered in the fields
   of cross-organizational interoperability, grid computing and task
   delegation but little addressed for cross-zone application deployment in
   Cloud Computing. This paper proposes a process model transformation
   technique based on activity aggregation to efficiently distribute
   services for the Web of Data between various Cloud availability zones.
   The authors propose a workflow decomposition method based on SPQR
   fragments and the definition of an efficient service distribution
   algorithm according to a defined cost model. This cost model considers
   not only the transmission of information between activities for data and
   control scopes but also the cost of activity execution in different
   regions. Finally the authors validate their method by providing a tool
   that introduces the distribution information into the workflow, applying
   their distribution algorithm in a use case and describing the
   transformation process to distributed BPEL code that can be easily
   deployed to back-end instances.}},

Abstract = {{Over the years, more cloud computing systems have been developed
   providing flexible interfaces for inter-cloud interaction. This work
   approaches the concept of inter-cloud by utilizing APIs, open source
   specifications and exposed interfaces from cloud platforms such as
   OpenStack, OpenNebula and others. Despite other works in the area of
   inter-cloud, that are mainly resource management-centric, we focus on
   designing and developing a service-centric architecture. We implement an
   inter-cloud bridge system that is elastic, easy to be upgraded and
   managed. We develop a prototype composed not only from heterogeneous
   cloud platforms but also from independent cloud services. These are
   developed by different cloud service providers and offered as open
   source Software as a Service (SaaS). The proposed Inter-Cloud Mediation
   Service uses Future Internet SaaS such as a Context Broker for
   registrations and subscriptions to services and a Complex Event
   Processing engine for event management. We present an experimental
   analysis to show interactions with various heterogeneous cloud platforms
   and we evaluate the performance of inter-cloud services separately and
   as a whole. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of Cloud Computing, new opportunities for Business
   Process Outsourcing services have emerged. Business Process as a Service
   (BPaaS), a new cloud service model, has recently gained a great
   importance for outsourcing cloud-based business processes constructed
   for multi-tenancy. In such a multi-tenant environment, using
   configurable business process models enables the sharing of a reference
   process among different tenants that can be customized according to
   specific needs. With a large choice of configurable process modeling
   languages, different providers may deliver configurable processes with
   common functionalities but different representations which makes the
   process discovery and configuration a manual tedious task. This in turn
   creates cloud silos and vendors lock-in with non-reusable configurable
   BPaaS models. Therefore, with the aim of enabling the interoperability
   between multiple BPaaS providers, we propose in this paper a semantic
   framework for BPaaS configurable models. Taking advantage of Semantic
   Web technologies and data mining techniques, our framework allows for
   (1) an ontology-based high level abstract representation of BPaaS
   configurable models enriched with configuration guidelines and (2) an
   automated approach for extracting the configuration guidelines from
   existing process repositories. To show the feasibility and effectiveness
   of our approach, we extend Signavio with our semantic framework and
   conduct experiments on a dataset from SAP reference model. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has changed the way organizations create, manage, and
   evolve their applications. While the abundance of computing resources at
   low cost opens up many possibilities for migrating applications to the
   cloud, this migration also comes at a price. Cloud applications, in many
   cases, depend on certain provider specific features or services. In
   moving applications to the cloud, application developers face the
   challenge of balancing these dependencies to avoid vendor lock-in. We
   present an abstraction-driven approach to address the application
   portability issues and focus on the application development process. We
   also present our theoretical basis and experience in two practical
   projects where we have applied the abstraction-driven approach.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has rapidly become the most effective computing paradigm
   for today's increasingly technology-dependent society. The emerging
   concepts of federated clouds with support for interoperability between
   different cloud providers and open standards in cloud middleware have
   opened up new challenges in cloud service management. One of the
   emerging research areas in cloud computing is the possibility of live
   virtual machine migration between different clouds. This is of
   importance when the quality of a cloud service currently used by a user
   degrades or a new cloud service is developed which is better in terms of
   quality, performance and cost than the current service being used. In
   such scenarios, the user needs to make a decision as to whether to
   continue with the currently used service or migrate to the newly
   available service. In our previous work, we presented a decision-making
   approach that assists a cloud service user in selecting a cloud service
   provider based on the QoS of its services. In this paper, we extend our
   previous work in the pre-interaction time phase and discuss the
   decision-making process involved in the migration from one cloud service
   to another cloud service through inter-cloud virtual machine migration.

Abstract = {{The emerging market of public and private cloud infrastructure benefits
   the end users, as it reduces their costs, introduces new efficient
   services and provides variety of products. End-users primary deal with
   private clouds or brokers, which serve all the users needs, and if
   needed, buy extra capacity from public cloud. In this paper we study
   such a three-level market structure. Our goal is to find Nash
   equilibrium of prices in this market as well as market influence on the
   end users. We observe that new resources at public clouds positively
   affect the market from the end-user perspective. Additionally our
   observation indicates that the switching cost plays an important role in
   achieving the optimal point in average market price value, and thus
   reduction of the switching costs will benefit end-users even more. Thus
   the results imply that standardization of the interfaces and
   interoperability between various clouds increases market efficiency. (C)

Abstract = {{Cloud federation can be described through the concept of collaboration,
   where each organization has its own cloud(s) that deals with a different
   and independent domain but needs to work together with other
   organizations in order to fulfill a specific shared objective. According
   to this perspective, the federation is a collection of interacting
   clouds that collaborate with one another through the instantiation and
   management of shared subsets of resources (computation and storage
   resources as well as sensors and actuators). This idea could be
   profitably used in those scenarios in which different organizations have
   to share several resources (e.g., emergency response or disaster
   management scenario). On the other hand, when different independent
   organizations share their resources, several issues arise. One of them
   is related to interoperability problems. As a consequence, this work
   also introduces a framework for an ontology-based resource life cycle
   management and provisioning in a federated cloud infrastructure.
   Therefore, The main contributions of this work consists of redesigning a
   cloud infrastructure architecture from the ground up, leveraging
   Semantic Web and Semantic Web Service Technologies, and natively
   supporting a federated provisioning of any kind of resource. This paper
   exploits, as a motivating scenario, a flood emergency response system.

Abstract = {{A real challenge sits in front of the business solutions these days, in
   the context of the big amount of data generated by complex software
   applications: efficiently using the given limited resources to
   accomplish specific operations and tasks. Depending on the type of
   application dealing with, when trying to deliver a certain service in a
   specific time and with a limited budget, a sequential application may be
   redesigned in a convenient way so that it will become scalable and able
   to run on multiple resources. Many task computing model brings together
   loosely coupled applications, composed of many dependent/independent
   tasks, which will work together for a common result. When asking for a
   certain service, the most frequently constraints addressed by the user
   are deadline and budget. This paper elaborates on a multi-objective
   scheduling algorithm of many tasks in Hadoop for big data processing,
   named MOMTH. We consider objective functions related to users and
   resources in the same time with constraints like deadline (scheduling in
   due time) and budget. The algorithm evaluation was realized in
   scheduling load simulator, a tool integrated in Hadoop. MobiWay, a
   collaboration platform that expose interoperability between a large
   number of sensing mobile devices and a wide-range of mobility
   applications, was chosen for performance analysis of MOMTH. We compared
   the proposed algorithm with first in first out and fair schedulers and
   we obtained similar performance for our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is increasing in usage because of its technical and
   financial advantages over traditional computing paradigms and also
   because of the availability of an expanding number of cloud services
   offered by new service providers. Consistent with its growth, there has
   been wide research interest in the literature that focuses on increasing
   cloud adoption. However, the current commercial and research-oriented
   cloud computing research in the literature mainly deals with
   functionalities closer to cloud infrastructure, such as improved
   performance and the management of virtualized resources, as well as
   fundamental issues related to efficient resource utilization, such as
   virtual machine (VM) migrations and server consolidation. While on the
   one hand, such features are very important, on the other hand, other
   important features, such as cloud quality of service management which is
   important for the cloud environment to move from a basic cloud service
   infrastructure to a broader cloud service ecosystem, have not received
   the required due attention. In cloud service management, a cloud service
   user has several choices for service selection and the quest to achieve
   interoperability and compatibility in cloud computing will consequently
   enable the user to easily migrate between service providers. In this
   scenario, the user needs to make important cloud service management
   decisions based on QoS, in addition to other criteria such as usage
   cost. These issues, when considered from a user's perspective, are quite
   different from cloud infrastructure management issues envisioned from a
   cloud provider's perspective. There are several challenges in cloud
   service management from a user's perspective, which the current cloud
   service management platforms in the literature do not address. To
   address this drawback, this paper presents a comprehensive
   state-of-the-art discussion on the existing approaches to cloud service
   management, critically evaluates them against the factors required for
   the user to manage the cloud service and presents a framework that
   assists the cloud service user in making cloud service management
   decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   middleware}},
Journal = {{SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{27-45}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{With the expansion of the Web, the desire toward global cooperation in
   the distributed simulation technology has also been on the rise.
   However, since current distributed simulation interoperability methods
   are coupled with system implementations, they place constraints on
   enhancing interoperability and synchronization algorithms. To enhance
   simulation interoperability on the Web, we implemented the RISE (RESTful
   Interoperability Simulation Environment) middleware, the first existing
   simulation middleware to be based on RESTful Web-services (WS). RISE is
   a general middleware that serves as a container to hold different
   simulation environments without being specific to a certain environment.
   RISE can hold heterogeneous simulations, and it exposes them as services
   via the Web. One of such services is called Distributed CD++ (DCD++)
   simulation system, an extension of the CD++ core engine that allows
   executing DEVS and Cell-DEVS models. Here, we introduce a
   proof-of-concept design and implementation of DCD++ using the
   distributed simulation using the RISE environment. We show how the
   RESTful WS interoperability style in RISE has improved the design,
   implementation and the performance of the DCD++ simulator. We also
   discuss a substantial performance improvement of the implementation of
   the RISE-based DCD++ presented here, showing many advantages of the
   RESTful WS presented here: improved interoperability, a seamless method
   to be connected into a cloud computing environment, and performance
   improvement when compared to our SOAP-based DCD++ in a similar testing
   environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Environment}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing offers a compelling vision of computation, enabling an
   unprecedented level of data distribution and sharing. Beyond improving
   the computing infrastructure, cloud computing enables a higher level of
   interoperability between information systems, simplifying tasks such as
   sharing documents between coworkers or enabling collaboration between an
   organization and its suppliers. While these abilities may result in
   significant benefits to users and organizations, they also present
   privacy challenges due to unwanted exposure of sensitive information. As
   information-sharing processes in cloud computing are complex and domain
   specific, configuring these processes can be an overwhelming and
   burdensome task for users. This article investigates the feasibility of
   configuring sharing processes through a small and representative set of
   canonical configuration options. For this purpose, we present a generic
   method, named SCON-UP (Simplified CON-figuration of User Preferences).
   SCON-UP simplifies configuration interfaces by using a clustering
   algorithm that analyzes a massive set of sharing preferences and
   condenses them into a small number of discrete disclosure levels. Thus,
   the user is provided with a usable configuration model while
   guaranteeing adequate privacy control. We describe the algorithm and
   empirically evaluate our model using data collected in two user studies
   (n = 121 and n = 352). Our results show that when provided with three
   canonical configuration options, on average, 82\% of the population can
   be covered by at least one option. We exemplify the feasibility of
   discretizing sharing levels and discuss the tradeoff between coverage
   and simplicity in discrete configuration options.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Establishment of trust between Cloud consumers and service providers is
   a challenging issue, which is a major reason why organizations are
   reluctant to adopt the Cloud paradigm. In order to resolve this issue,
   various trust models have been proposed for the Cloud domain; however,
   none of these models are widely accepted by the industry because they
   only cover a few aspects of trust establishment, and do not support all
   the essential features. Several problems exist in the Cloud trust
   models, but lack of standardization and interoperability are the primary
   concerns. Similarly, there is no such generic and comprehensive trust
   model that can establish trust on all the layers of Cloud services,
   namely software, platform and infrastructure. Moreover, existing trust
   models have their limitations in terms of providing essential
   functionality and security features for trust evaluation. In order to
   provide reliable trust establishment in the Cloud environment, there is
   an indispensable need to carry out research and gather knowledge about
   the functional and nonfunctional features offered by the existing Cloud
   trust models. Comprehensive research about trust models would further
   help the Cloud consumers in the selection of an appropriate model,
   according to their security and functional requirements. In this paper,
   we have performed in-depth analysis of the existing trust models in the
   Cloud, considering the essential functional and non-functional aspects
   to accurately evaluate the trust of the Cloud providers. We present
   panoramic taxonomies covering state of the art features, which are
   considered critical for trust models to effectively establish and
   evaluate the trust between Cloud consumers and providers. Furthermore,
   we have applied the proposed taxonomies as assessment criteria for the
   analysis of various trust models in the Cloud domain. In order to
   effectively demonstrate the realization and use of proposed taxonomies
   in real life scenarios, we have presented an extensive case study about
   the Health Information Exchange System.}},

Abstract = {{To date a few, big providers dominate the market of Cloud resources.
   They provide proprietary solutions through inflexible pricing and SLA
   schemes. On the research side, the community is working to define
   specifications and standards on several aspects of the cloud technology.
   When standards will get mature, interoperability among clouds will be a
   reality. Customers will be no more locked-up to any proprietary
   technology and new players will have the chance to enter the market. The
   competition challenge will be played on the real capability of providers
   to accommodate customers' requests in a flexible way and to supply high
   and differentiated QoS levels. In this market scenario a mechanism must
   be devised to support the matchmaking between what providers offer and
   what customers' applications demand. In this work we propose the
   definition of a semantic model that helps customers and providers to
   characterize their demands/offers, and provide semantic tools performing
   the matchmaking in such a way to maximize both the provider's profit and
   the customer's utility. The proposal has been validated by running tests
   on a software prototype of the discovery framework.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a Personal Health Book application that is used as a
   portable repository for Personal Health Records (PHR) in order to
   alleviate healthcare organizational problems in developing countries.
   The Personal Health Book application allows low literate people to
   access and carry their own medical history from a rural healthcare
   provider to an urban healthcare provider. This will improve the
   efficiency of medical care and lower costs for health clinics in
   underserved areas. This paper introduces a software application that can
   be ported onto a USB Smart Card or/and managed by smartphone or personal
   computer connected to cloud computing environment. The Portable Health
   Book application aims to ease the problem of interoperability between
   health clinics by accepting any file format and contents and applies a
   decomposed database to categorize, group and reorganize the data.
   Querying the application's database, the consumer can create a unified
   report presentation that is understandable by the consumer, family, and
   healthcare provider. We tested the Personal Health Book framework by
   importing PHRs in an extensible markup language (XML) format with a
   basic structure, without checking the PHR content from the Grameen
   Portable Health Clinic database in Bangladesh and from different
   departments from a hospital in Japan. The Personal Health Book was able
   to generate a human readable output as its database reorganize and store
   any type of PHR including sensor device data.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a network access model that aims to transparently and
   ubiquitously share a large number of computing resources. These are
   leased by a service provider to digital customers, usually through the
   Internet. Due to the increasing number of traffic accidents and
   dissatisfaction of road users in vehicular networks, the major focus of
   current solutions provided by intelligent transportation systems is on
   improving road safety and ensuring passenger comfort. Cloud computing
   technologies have the potential to improve road safety and traveling
   experience in ITSs by providing flexible solutions (i.e., alternative
   routes, synchronization of traffic lights, etc.) needed by various road
   safety actors such as police, and disaster and emergency services. In
   order to improve traffic safety and provide computational services to
   road users, a new cloud computing model called VANET-Cloud applied to
   vehicular ad hoc networks is proposed. Various transportation services
   provided by VANET-Cloud are reviewed, and some future research
   directions are highlighted, including security and privacy, data

Abstract = {{Mobile phone users are demanding an efficient convergent communication
   approach for efficient communication and information sharing with their
   real life social circles. Unfortunately, the existing telecom services
   and the popular Internet services are not organically integrated to
   provide convenient convergent services. To overcome this issue, one of
   the promising convergent communication services considered by telecom
   carriers is RCS (Rich Communication Suite). However, existing issues,
   such as insufficient interoperability among different operators,
   shortage of terminals and heavy dependence on large-scale IP multimedia
   subsystem (IMS) network deployment, mean that it will take time to
   implement RCS across worldwide networks and for it to become a service
   equally universal as voice and short message. Instead of a heavyweight
   RCS solution, in this paper, we propose a lightweight, quick deployment
   mobile phone book application system based on cloud computing without a
   fully deployed IP multimedia subsystem infrastructure, which seamlessly
   integrates traditional telecommunication services, instant messaging
   services, social networking services and automatic contact information
   management. Based on this, Telco-OTT' service provision approach,
   telecom carriers can allow their subscribers to enjoy conveniently the
   rich convergent personal service experience quickly without a large
   initial investment. Thus, it is a low-risk opportunity for telecom
   carriers to meet subscriber demand for advanced user-centric convergent
   service features. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The gap between technology and learning methods has two important
   implications: on the one hand, we should not expect the integration of
   technological advances into teaching to be an easy task; and there is a
   danger that mature educational technologies and methods might not give
   an adequate answer to the demands and needs of society, underusing their
   transforming potential to improve learning processes. This study
   discusses the need for a new technological environment supporting
   learning services, and proposes the concept of the technological
   learning ecosystem as a solution to both problems. Educational
   ecosystems should be able to break the technological constraints of
   existing learning platforms and achieve an effective improvement in
   learning processes. Our proposed educational ecosystems pivot around
   five specific lines of action: 1) a framework architecture that supports
   learning service-based ecosystems; 2) learning analytics for educational
   decision making; 3) adaptive knowledge systems; 4) gamification of
   learning processes; 5) semantic portfolios to collect evidence of
   learning.}},

   the services from different cloud service providers so that resources
   will be properly utilized. To execute and handle the complex business
   application over clouds as demands by the users, interoperable solution
   is provided. Federated cloud computation gives the advantage of cost
   reduction and energy saving. Cloud architecture uses virtualization
   technique for having the provision of more than one virtual machine on
   the same physical host. Interoperable cloud architecture solves the
   problem of vendor lock-in and portability, saves energy reduce power
   consumption and promote green cloud computing. This paper describes

Abstract = {{Cloud computing, featured by shared servers and location independent
   services, has been widely adopted by various businesses to increase
   computing efficiency, and reduce operational costs. Despite significant
   benefits and interests, enterprises have a hard time to decide whether
   or not to migrate thousands of servers into the cloud because of various
   reasons such as lack of holistic migration (planning) tools, concerns on
   data security and cloud vendor lock-in. In particular, cloud security
   has become the major concern for decision makers, due to the nature
   weakness of virtualization -the fact that the cloud allows multiple
   users to share resources through Internet-facing interfaces can be
   easily taken advantage of by hackers. Therefore, setting up a secure
   environment for resource migration becomes the top priority for both
   enterprises and cloud providers. To achieve the goal of security,
   security policies such as firewalls and access control have been widely
   adopted, leading to significant cost as additional resources need to
   employed. In this paper, we address the challenge of the security-aware
   virtual server migration, and propose a migration strategy that
   minimizes the migration cost while promising the security needs of
   enterprises. We prove that the proposed security-aware cost minimization
   problem is NP-hard and our solution can achieve an approximate factor of
   2. We perform an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance
   of the proposed solution under various settings. Our simulation results
   demonstrate that our approach can save 53\% moving cost for a single
   enterprise case, and 66\% for multiple enterprises case comparing to a
   random migration strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there are many problems of the application development of
   E-Assessment such as the difficulty to use the assessment object from a
   platform to another one. In addition, the domain model reuse rate is
   very low in various application systems, and hardness to guarantee the
   consistency between designs and codes. Therefore, to resolve these
   problems, we need an approach aiming to automate the modeling and coding
   processes in e-assessment system. The present study describes an
   approach, based on service cloud computing, for integrating e-assessment
   functionalities of candidate LMS systems into a generalized e-assessment
   process. The proposed approach is based on three steps. The first step
   consists on development of generic e-assessment process based on reverse
   engineering. The second step describes a set mapping rules to adapt this
   generic e-assessment process on the learning profiles. To ensure more
   flexibility in the generated e-assessment process, we create a composite
   cloud service that's defining the mapping rules. The third step consists
   of defining the resulting e-assessment process as a composite cloud
   service allowing flexibility and interoperability between any LMS
   e-assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) adopts and extends the concept of cloud
   computing to make mass Manufacturing Resources and Capabilities (MR/Cs)
   more widely integrated and accessible to users through the Internet.
   However, a single manufacturing cloud (MC) only has relatively limited
   scalability and elasticity. Using the aggregated MR/Cs from multiple MCs
   is a natural evolution. To address this requirement, we propose an
   integration framework for multiple MCs, so that MCs can collaboratively
   cope with peak user demands for MR/Cs. The key functional modules and
   the business model of the proposed framework are presented to guide
   future integration of multiple MCs. The enabling technologies, such as
   semantic web and ontologies, intelligent agents, service oriented
   architecture, and material handling and logistics technologies are also
   discussed. An application example is given, showing the feasibility and
   rationality of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous services are developed using cloud computing technology. It is
   possible to use service from remote location, not in place of local
   computer. Accordingly, the research groups predict that the scale of
   cloud service also will be grown. One of cloud computing's advantage is
   scalability. It can extend its service scale and range using
   collaboration between cloud service providers. To make it possible,
   however, interoperability is required in that environment. Cross-Layered
   SLA architecture is the cloud service environment that supports
   interoperability. In this paper, we propose aggregation functions and
   quality model for QoE metrics and newly generating Service Level
   Agreement in cross-layered SLA architecture. We expect that this
   aggregation function and quality model will solve the possible problems
   in the cloud service area.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid advances in digitalization, Internet and world wide web enable the
   communication between two computing hosts across any location in the
   globe. Pervasive or ubiquitous computing enhanced this to a level that
   any two intelligent physical objects can communicate with each other,
   anytime and anywhere. Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm
   emerging from ubiquitous computing that facilitates communication
   between many real world objects by collaboration of various
   technologies. Integrating IoT with Cloud Computing derives manifold
   advantages to store and process enormous data generated by heterogeneous
   devices. Though both the technologies together have profound effect in
   many application areas like smart home, smart agriculture, healthcare
   etc., their integration involves many challenges. Security is one of the
   most important issues confronted by IoT-Cloud architecture. In this
   paper, we propose a Secure, Hybrid, Cloud Enabled architecture for IoT
   (SHCEI), which uses hybrid cloud (both public and private cloud). This
   architecture ensures security of intradomain data and will also address
   issues of scalability and interoperability. Further, we highlight some
   of the research challenges in implementing the combined architecture of

Abstract = {{A single cloud provider alone is not able to satisfy the increasing
   demand for its services as the number of online users and services
   deployed by organizations grow exponentially. To achieve the promises of
   cloud computing, the necessity of aggregating different cloud provider
   into a single framework emerges. This concept overcomes the limitations
   of interoperability, portability, vendor lock in problem, scalability
   and elasticity of contemporary cloud computing. Collaborating with
   different cloud providers is not an easy task because each cloud
   provider has different kinds of architecture, virtualization technology,
   service level agreement, enterprise solution and interface for accessing
   services. This scenario is identified by many synonyms in the literature
   such as cloud federation, Intercloud, Multi-Cloud etc. This paper
   discusses various driving forces and advantages that attract researchers
   towards it. Further, this paper concentrates on exploring related work
   done in addressing different issues and finding gaps that will create
   opportunities for further research and development. This work will tend
   to emerge as a step towards the next-generation enterprise solution.}},

Abstract = {{Service Level Agreement (SLA), a contract between IT service provider
   and customer, clearly defines hardware and software parameters to ensure
   Quality of Service (QoS). Cloud Service Brokering (CSB) provides either
   API or User Interface (UI) between service subscriber and service
   provider which enable interoperability between several separate clouds
   to improve service intermediation, aggregation and arbitrage. Today,
   SLA-based brokering technology is emerging and has been used to ensure
   QoS for Inter-Cloud environment. In this paper, we surveyed and
   evaluated some of the latest SLA-based service brokering projects.
   Additionally, we discussed a high level architectural view of cloud
   service broker derived from these projects.}},

Abstract = {{The Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of death
   from cancer in the developed regions. In this paper we address the
   necessity to develop tools by which the oncologists will easily identify
   molecular targets for treatment and perform immediate diagnosis.
   Considering the increase of available microarray experiments and the DNA
   chips' potentiality for extracting knowledge from the genes'
   expressions, we present the design of a new platform for CRC gene
   expression analysis whose usage target are both the researchers and the
   medical persons. The platform is set on predefined and original
   statistical methodologies for accurate inference in CRC, biomarkers
   extraction, CRC stage prognosis, etc. In order to avoid the limitations
   of the local infrastructure, the proposed architecture takes the
   advantage of the cloud's speed and flexibility to perform large-scale
   computations and to be easily upgradable with new tools. The platform we
   present is equivalent to the Software as a Service level of abstraction
   from an end-user point of view. From a developer's point of view, we use
   the Platform as a Service level of abstraction, which means we control
   virtualized instances that are already offered by the Cloud Service
   Provider. Those instances are set on the Infrastructure as a Service
   level of the cloud, its storing and processing capacity. Mainly, the
   platform is comprised of four distinctive modules: User Interface -
   interface between the user, the software and the biological databases;
   Machine Learning -the core where the data is processed; Distributed
   Processing - splits and spreads the problem through the available
   instances; and Resources Controlling module - determines the best
   combination of resources in terms of performance and cost depending on
   the problem size. A detailed description of each module, as well as the
   latest concerns of cloud's interoperability and portability is discussed
   in the paper. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In e-Health, interoperability among information systems is required in
   order to consolidate electronic health records. Such interoperability
   challenge has been tackled in well developed countries by approaches
   based on Health Record Banks and Software as a Service architectures.
   Nevertheless these approaches are difficult to adapt and deploy into the
   context of developing countries. That is the case of Colombia, which
   lacks of an integrated health system. In this paper, an architectural
   proposal for consolidating health records in the context of the
   Colombian health system is presented. To this end, a Health Catalogue
   Repository is introduced. It incorporates concepts such as community
   cloud, Health Record Banks, and Software as a Service architectures. The
   proposed Health Catalogue Repository is conceived to regulate the
   access, management, storage and secure sharing mechanisms of clinical
   data, by a patient self-management approach, whilst confidentiality is
   ensured. A set of Software as a Service, related to the Health Catalogue
   Repository is outlined and discussed. A qualitative analysis of the
   proposal, in regard to drawbacks and learned lesson from similar
   previous experiences, is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The HLA framework is widely used to formalize simulations and achieve
   reusability and interoperability of simulation components. In order to
   manage the underlying system of HLA-based simulations, Grid Computing
   and Cloud Computing are employed to tackle the details of operation,
   configuration, and maintenance of simulation platforms that simulation
   applications run on. However, to make a simulation-run-ready environment
   among different types of computing resources and network environments is
   challenging, especially for modelers who may not be familiar with the
   management of distributed systems. In this article, we propose a new
   cloud-based scheme for HLA-based simulations, aiming to ease the
   management of underlying resources, particularly for those located on
   geographically distributed locations, and to achieve rapid elasticity
   that can provide adequate computing capability to end users. An approach
   for handling diverse network environments is given; by adopting it, idle
   public resources can be easily configured as additional computing
   resources for the local cloud infrastructure. In the experiments,
   compared with its corresponding Grid Computing platform, this Cloud
   Computing platform achieves a similar performance but with many
   advantages that Cloud can provide, such as energy consumption, security,
   and multi-user availability.}},

Abstract = {{Future smart cities would integrate a wide range of mostly heterogeneous
   systems and ICT is an essential asset in the coordination of those. The
   smart buildings, a major smart cities research and development domain,
   should advance beyond the complex automation tools and the anticipated
   energy and comfort envelope. The universal convergence to technologies
   that would enable the seamless integration with the anticipated smart
   cities urban environment should be highlighted. Although it is a concept
   widely accepted for current and future developing standards, it is much
   less communicated across scientific fields as for example the urban
   development and building automation. Even worse its necessity, in the
   latter, is frequently challenged. This paper firstly will try to address
   the market and scientific criticism towards a fully web-services enabled
   building in a fair and transparent approach. Secondly it proposes a
   system as an interoperability layer able to build advanced managements
   schemes by integrating the assets of current automation and monitoring
   systems to the Internet backbone.}},

Abstract = {{IDIPOS, that stands for Italian Database Infrastructure for Polar
   Observation Sciences, has been conceived to realize a feasibility study
   on infrastructure devoted to management of data coming from Polar areas.
   This framework adopted a modular approach identifying two main parts:
   the first one defines main components of infrastructure, and, the latter
   selects possible cloud solutions to manage and organize these
   components. The main purpose is the creation of a scalable and flexible
   infrastructure for the exchange of scientific data from various
   application fields. The envisaged infrastructure is based on the
   cutting-edge technology of the Community Cloud Infrastructure for an
   aggregation and federation of resources, to optimize the use of
   hardware. The infrastructure is composed of: a central node, several
   nodes distributed in Italy, interconnection between other systems
   realized in Polar areas. This paper aims to investigate cloud solution,
   and explore the key factors which may influence cloud adoption in the
   project such as scalability, flexibility and expandability. In
   particular, main cloud aspects addressed are related to data storage,
   data management, data analysis, infrastructure federation following

Abstract = {{Traffic engineering is a key in effective utilisation of the road
   network infrastructure. Simulation assists traffic engineers making
   informed decisions on how to operate and direct traffic within the road
   networks. These simulations are complex, generate big data and require
   high-powered computers, which can process information faster than real
   time, to ensure the results can be used to affect traffic. Cloud
   computing, a relatively new technology paradigm, can meet the essential
   requirements, such as scalability, interoperability, availability and
   high-end performance. In this paper, a novel approach to a
   synchronisation strategy of large-scale complex simulations is proposed.
   This approach builds upon advancements achieved in distributed
   computing. The new synchronisation strategy is designed to allow
   different granularities of synchronisation accuracy. Through this
   strategy, synchronisation overhead is reduced, thus allowing the
   computing bandwidth to be applied to simulation performance increases as
   a result of the trade off between synchronisation accuracy and
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing adoption of Cloud Computing, Business Process as a
   Service (BPaaS) has recently emerged as the delivery of business process
   outsourcing services that are sourced from the cloud and constructed for
   multitenancy. BPaaS providers may look for available business processes
   from other cloud providers to improve their processes. However, today's
   BPaaS solutions lack an explicit and formal semantics which prevent an
   easy and dynamic interoperability between different cloud providers. In
   this paper, we propose firstly to semantically populate a shared
   knowledge base of process models deployed by BPaaS providers. Therefore,
   using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a
   business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist
   process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a
   neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between
   tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments
   to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of
   concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve
   similar process fragments that can be used to design new process
   variants. We also performed experiments on large public datasets and
   experimental results show that our approach is feasible and efficient.}},

Abstract = {{In the age of cloud computing, the amount of data and services available
   for researchers continues to grow. As data are easier to generate and
   services simpler to deploy, researchers continue to face insurmountable
   integration and interoperability challenges. A major ongoing issue
   across many fields regards the automated and real-time integration of
   data and services. Besides aggregating and processing disparate sources,
   we need an always up-to-date view of our heterogeneous and distributed
   datasets. Enabling realistic insights over acquired information requires
   that data are as fresh as possible. This perspective appears in
   opposition to traditional warehousing strategies, where data are
   manipulated regularly over large intervals. Our proposal introduces a
   reactive and event-driven framework to simplify and automate real-time
   data integration and interoperability. This platform, entitled i2x,
   streamlines the creation of customizable integration tasks connecting
   heterogeneous data sources with any kind of services. Integration is
   poll-based, with intelligent agents monitoring data sources, or
   push-based, where the platform waits for data submission by external
   resources. i2x delivers data to services through a comprehensive
   template engine, where the platform maps data from the original data
   source to the destination resources. i2x is an open-source framework
   available online at https://bioinformatics.ua.pt/i2x/.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an efficient and cost effective realization of the
   utility function principle. Over the last years, a vast pool of choices
   for businesses has been created. This diversity of cloud
   infrastructures, platforms, and tools creates several challenges. In
   particular, it hinders interoperability, promotes vendor lock-in, but
   more importantly prevents businesses from making informed and optimal
   decisions when transitioning to the cloud. This paper presents the
   results of a business-oriented evaluation for cloud computing in the
   industry in Cyprus. The evaluation confirms that a set of key features
   is important for overcoming the above challenges and enables businesses
   to exploit the full potential of the cloud. Finally, PaaSage, a platform
   for autonomic multi-cloud deployment addressing these key features, is
   shortly presented.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud federation is foreseen to happen among large cloud providers. The
   resulting interoperability of cloud services among these providers will
   then increase even more the elasticity of cloud services. The cloud
   provisioned that is targeted by this scenario is mainly one which
   combines the cloud services offered by large enterprises. Cloud
   computing, however, has started moving to the edge. We now increasingly
   see the tendency to fullfil cloud computing requirements by multiple
   levels and different kind of infrastructures, where the Fog Computing
   paradigm has started playing its role. For this scenario of edge
   computing, we show in this paper the case of the federation of multiple
   independent micro-cloud providers within a community network, where
   providers pool their resources and services into a community cloud.
   Federation happens here primarily at the service level and the domain of
   trust is the community of practice. While we can today already report
   this case in the context of community networks, IPv6 deployment in the
   Internet will principally allow micro-cloud providers to appear
   everywhere, needing cloud federation mechanisms. We describe for a real
   case how this micro-cloud provider federation has been built and argue
   why micro-cloud provider should be considered for the integration in
   cloud federations.}},

Abstract = {{The IEEE P2302 Intercloud WG conducts work since 2011 on the project
   Standard for Intercloud Interoperability and Federation with the goal to
   define a standard architecture and building components for large-scale
   interoperability of independent cloud providers. While the
   standardization process has achieved fine-grained definitions of several
   Intercloud components, a deployment of the Intercloud to demonstrate the
   architectural feasibility is not yet operational. In this paper, we
   describe a deployed community network cloud and we show how it matches
   in several aspects the vision of the Intercloud. Similar to the
   Intercloud, the community network cloud consists of many small cloud
   providers, which for interoperability use a set of common services. In
   this sense, the community network cloud is a real use case for elements
   that the Intercloud standardization WG envisions, and can feed back to
   and even become part of the Intercloud. In fact, a study on Small or
   Medium Enterprise (SME) provided commercial services in the community
   network cloud indicates the importance of the success of the Intercloud
   standardization initiative for SMEs.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable efforts have been spent on designing architectures to
   manage heterogeneous resources across multiple administrative domains.
   Specific fields of application are federated cloud computing
   (Intercloud) approaches and distributed testbeds, among others. An
   important interoperability challenge that arises in this context is the
   exchange of information about the provided resources and their
   dependencies. Existing work usually rests upon schematic data models,
   which impede the discovery and management of heterogeneous resources
   between autonomous sites. One way of addressing this issue is to
   exchange semantic information models. In this paper, we exploit such
   approaches to formally define federations, including their
   infrastructures and the life-cycle of the offered resources and
   services. The requirements of this work have been derived from several
   research projects and the results are in process of being standardized
   by an international body. The main contribution of this work is a higher
   level (upper) ontology and initial integration concepts for it. These
   contributions form a basis for further work in the general context of
   distributed semantic resource management.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Background, Motivation and Objective: Academic study of Cloud
   Computing within Saudi Arabia is an emerging research field. Saudi
   Arabia represents the largest economy in the Arabian Gulf region. This
   positions it as a potential market of cloud computing technologies.
   Adoption of new innovations should be preceded by analysis of the added
   value, challenges and adequacy from technological, organizational and
   environmental perspectives. (2) Statement of Contribution/Method: This
   cross-sectional exploratory empirical research is based on Technology,
   Organization and Environment model targeting higher education
   institutions. In this study, the factors that influence the adoption by
   higher education institutions were analyzed and tested using Partial
   Least Square. (3) Results, Discussion and Conclusions: Three factors
   were found significant in this context. Relative Advantage, Data Privacy
   and Complexity are the most significant factors. The model explained
   43\% of the total adoption measure variation. Significant differences in
   the areas of cloud computing compatibility, complexity, vendor lock-in
   and peer pressure between large and small institutions were revealed.
   Items for future cloud computing research were explored through
   open-ended questions. Adoption of cloud services by higher education
   institutions has been started. It was found that the adoption rate among
   large universities is higher than small higher education institutions.
   Improving the network and Internet Infrastructure in Saudi Arabia at an
   affordable cost is a pre-requisite for cloud computing adoption. Cloud
   service provider should address the privacy and complexity concerns
   raised by non-adopters. Future information systems that are potential
   for hosting in cloud were prioritized.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing is the state of the art computation paradigm enabling
   providers to offer computing resources to customers in a pay-per-use
   fashion. Nowadays public Cloud providers offer similar services within
   few service models, mainly IaaS and PaaS. Cloud providers give to the
   user the feeling to dispose of infinite resources, thus having to
   predict the user requirements in order to provide services with minimal
   costs, maintaining at the same time high levels of SLAs. In order to
   achieve this goal, Cloud providers can cooperate together to bring new
   business opportunities, such as expanding available resources, achieving
   cost effective asset optimization and adopting power saving policies.
   Cloud Federation allows different Cloud providers the opportunity to
   work collaboratively to offer best services to customers and
   contemporary to improve their productivity. Customers can advantage from
   Cloud Federation for a larger offer of available services, the
   capability of price comparison and the removal of vendor lock-in. In
   this paper we describe a platform that enables the federation of several
   heterogeneous Cloud Providers to allow the customers choosing and
   activating Cloud services from a central platform, bringing more
   attractive price policy to customers. The authors introduce a prototype
   of Cloud Federation platform based on a central infrastructure tested to
   manage OpenStack, CloudStack and Amazon EC2 providers, thus allowing the
   user to select the best services in terms of either technical
   requirements or price policy and activate them without having to
   explicitly register to each of the federated providers. The prototype is
   designed to accept different types of Cloud service models by means of
   transparent interfaces developed around a billing and a metering module,
   respectively to bill the service to the customer and to collect
   information about the health status of the federated platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The concurrent popularity of wearable sensors and Internet-of-Things
   (IoT) brings significant benefits to body sensor networks (BSN) that
   could communicate with the cloud computing platforms for bringing
   interoperability in health and wellness monitoring. We designed
   Pulse-Glasses that are cloud-connected, wearable, smart eyeglasses for
   unobtrusive and continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring. We 3D-printed the
   first prototype of Pulse-Glasses that use a photoplethysmography (PPG)
   sensor on one of the nose-pads to collect HR data. We integrated other
   circuits including an embedded board with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and
   a rechargeable battery inside the two temples of Pulse-Glasses. We
   implemented IoT functionalities such that HR data are recorded from
   Pulse-Glasses, visualized on an Android smartphone, and stored
   seamlessly on the cloud. In this paper, we present the developments of
   Pulse-Glasses hardware including IoT services and the preliminary
   results from validation experiments. We compared Pulse-Glasses with a
   laboratory ECG system to cross-validate HR data collected during various
   activities-sitting, talking, and walking-performed by a participant. We
   used Pulse-Glasses to record HR data of a driver to test IoT
   functionalities of location services and BLE and cloud connectivity. The
   first set of results is promising and demonstrates the prospect of
   Pulse-Glasses in the field of cloud-connected BSN.}},

Abstract = {{Porting applications to Clouds is one of the key challenges in software
   industry. The available approaches to perform this task are basically
   either services derived from alliances of major software vendors and
   Cloud providers focusing on their own products, or small platform
   providers focusing on the most popular software stacks. For migrating
   other types of software, the options are limited to
   Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions which require a lot of
   programming effort for adapting the software to a Cloud provider's API.
   Moreover, if it must be deployed in different providers, new integration
   procedures must be designed and implemented which could be a nightmare.
   This paper presents a solution for facilitating the migration of any
   application to the cloud, inferring the most suitable deployment model
   for the application and automatically deploying it in the available

Abstract = {{Over the last years, the utilization of cloud resources has been
   steadily rising and an increasing number of enterprises are moving
   applications to the cloud. A leading trend is the adoption of Platform
   as a Service to support rapid application deployment. By providing a
   managed environment, cloud platforms take away a lot of complex
   configuration effort required to build scalable applications. However,
   application migrations to and between clouds cost development effort and
   open up new risks of vendor lock-in. This is problematic because
   frequent migrations may be necessary in the dynamic and fast changing
   cloud market. So far, the effort of application migration in PaaS
   environments and typical issues experienced in this task are hardly
   understood. To improve this situation, we present a cloud-to-cloud
   migration of a real-world application to seven representative cloud
   platforms. In this case study, we analyze the feasibility of the
   migrations in terms of portability and the effort of the migrations. We
   present a Docker-based deployment system that provides the ability of
   isolated and reproducible measurements of deployments to platform
   vendors, thus enabling the comparison of platforms for a particular
   application. Using this system, the study identifies key problems during
   migrations and quantifies these differences by distinctive metrics.}},

Abstract = {{It is increasingly being recognized that faster socioeconomic
   development in Africa is dependent upon the development of Information
   and Communication Technology (ICT) Infrastructure for the dissemination
   of data and educational services. The scalability and flexibility
   provided by Cloud services in terms of resource management, service
   provisioning and virtualization makes it an attractive system for use
   with educational and ICT services. The flexibility of pay-as-you-go
   models combined with the ability to scale computing, storage and/or
   networking resources makes Cloud computing an ideal candidate for use
   with education, research and scientific infrastructures. Notwithstanding
   its benefits, transitioning from a traditional IT infrastructure to a
   Cloud computing paradigm raises security concerns with respect to data
   storage, data transmission and user privacy. This paper presents
   on-going research for the development of Science, Technology and
   Innovation (STI) infrastructure for the distribution of Information
   Communication technologies (ICT) services in the African context. The
   Inter-Cloud Infrastructure Framework (ICIF) proposed, is conceived as a
   Cloud computing framework suitable for use with National Research and
   Education Networks (NRENs) in the SADC region. The ICIF system is used
   to create an Inter-Cloud infrastructure, and helps NRENs transition from
   traditional IT infrastructure systems to the Cloud computing paradigm.
   It also provides new functional/operational components and Cloud
   services to support the interconnection and/or interoperability among
   SADC NRENs through the ICIF infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Scientists gain benefits from scalable resource provisioning on-demand,
   and various computing environments by using cloud computing resources
   for their applications. However, many cloud computing providers offer
   their cloud resources according to their own rules. The descriptions of
   various cloud resources also differ for each vendor. Subsequently, it
   becomes difficult to find suitable cloud resources given the
   characteristics of an application. Scientists therefore, select
   resources used in previous experiments or best performance resources
   without considering the characteristics of their applications. There is
   the need to standardize notations to support simple selection of cloud
   resources without the constraints of providers. Intercloud can use cloud
   resources without considering cloud providers in hybrid cloud
   environments. Intercloud project has been studied for interoperability
   and creates mOSAIC ontology to conceptualize various resources. However,
   the mOSAIC ontology attributes are limited when considering
   characteristics of an application. We propose a semantic engine to
   provide semantic cloud resource services in intercloud environment. We
   define a rule of categorized resource description with reference to
   mOSAIC ontology attributes which includes added factors needed to
   represent application characteristics. We also develop a semantic engine
   which can choose semantically similar cloud resources using statistical
   analysis while considering the characteristics of an application. The
   semantic engine can also classify resources dynamically according to
   application specifications.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing technology offers new opportunities for outsourcing
   data, and outsourcing computation to individuals, start-up businesses,
   and corporations in health care. Although cloud computing paradigm
   provides interesting, and cost effective opportunities to the users, it
   is not mature, and using the cloud introduces new obstacles to users.
   For instance, vendor lock-in issue that causes a healthcare system rely
   on a cloud vendor infrastructure, and it does not allow the system to
   easily transit from one vendor to another. Cloud data privacy is another
   issue and data privacy could be violated due to outsourcing data to a
   cloud computing system, in particular for a healthcare system that
   archives and processes sensitive data. In this paper, we present a novel
   cloud computing platform based on a Service-Oriented cloud architecture.
   The proposed platform can be ran on the top of heterogeneous cloud
   computing systems that provides standard, dynamic and customizable
   services for eHealth systems. The proposed platform allows heterogeneous
   clouds provide a uniform service interface for eHealth systems that
   enable users to freely transfer their data and application from one
   vendor to another with minimal modifications. We implement the proposed
   platform for an eHealth system that maintains patients' data privacy in
   the cloud. We consider a data accessibility scenario with implementing
   two methods, AES and a light-weight data privacy method to protect
   patients' data privacy on the proposed platform. We assess the
   performance and the scalability of the implemented platform for a
   massive electronic medical record. The experimental results show that
   the proposed platform have not introduce additional overheads when we
   run data privacy protection methods on the proposed platform.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging field of Cloud Computing provides several advantages over
   traditional in-house IT services, such as accessing to elastic on-demand
   computing and storage over the Internet, and cost effective pay-per-use
   subscription plans. However, according to the International Data
   Corporation (IDC), cloud computing has several issues, such as a lack of
   standardization, a lack of customization, and limited interoperability.
   In addition, there is an increasing demand for introduction and
   migration of a variety of services to cloud computing systems, which are
   abstract their offering services into various {*}-as-a-Services ({*}aaS)
   layers. Although each such service provides a new feature (e.g.,
   simulation services in cloud), it aggravates the issues due to the lack
   of standardization and inability to customize services by a vendor
   because each {*}aaS has its own features, requirements and output. In
   this paper, we propose a cloud architecture to alleviate issues
   associated with standardization and customization. In the cloud, the
   proposed architecture uses a single layer, called Template-as-a-Service
   (TaaS), to provide: (i) a single service layer for interaction with all
   resources and major cloud services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and {*}aaS),
   (ii) a standardization for existing services and future {*}aaS across
   different cloud environments, and (iii) a customizable architecture
   which can be modified on demand by a cloud vendor, and its partners to
   provide the flexibility on cloud computing systems. A comparison with
   previous studies show that the proposed architecture provides
   customization and standardization for cloud services with minimum
   modifications.}},

Abstract = {{This track started with the first Cloud Computing session in WETICE2009
   with the observation that the cloud computing evolution depends on
   research efforts from the infrastructure providers creating next
   generation hardware that is service friendly, service developers that
   embed business service intelligence in the network to create distributed
   business workflow execution, assure service delivery on a massive scale
   with global interoperability while dealing with non-functional
   requirements such as security, availability, performance, compliance,
   cost and fluctuations both in resources and workloads. It was pointed
   out that the architecture and evolution of the cloud is increasing
   datacenter complexity by piling up new layers of management over the
   many layers that already exist. Current session proves the epigram by
   Jean-Baptiste (1849) ``plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.{''}
   Literally ``The more it changes, the more it's the same thing{''}. In
   this conference, one paper presents the result of the discussions
   started in these sessions in 2009 that led to a policy based dynamic
   workflow orchestration independent of the infrastructure orchestration
   which eliminates the need for moving Virtual Machine images and
   interfaces to myriad infrastructure management systems at runtime. The
   architecture is derived from the well-understood and time-tested
   distributed systems such as cellular organisms, human organizational
   structures and telecommunication networks. In addition, eight full
   papers and three short papers continue to make progress on current state
   of the art. Based on the papers presented in these sessions over the
   last six years, we boldly predict that we are on the verge of a
   synthesis of the thesis of current state of the art and the antithesis
   of increasing complexity to address scaling and fluctuations in
   distributed systems.}},

Abstract = {{The growing popularity of cloud computing has magnified the rise of
   software reuse by facilitating service provisioning over the Internet.
   At the same time, a new generation of mobile apps has emerged relying on
   backend services that expand the app functionally, while reducing the
   overhead on limited mobile resources. The Web service approach promises
   great flexibility in offering software functionality over the network,
   while maintaining interoperability between heterogeneous platforms. In
   addition, recent years have witnessed the rise of user-facing service
   developments that can be consumed on-the-go with a standard interface,
   such as RESTful Web services. However, the discovery of such services
   does not match their growing popularity and remain challenging. Users
   cannot tolerate long latency in finding relevant services to their
   requests. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient Web service
   discovery approach that uses statistical methods and indexing techniques
   to improve the precision and response time of the discovery process.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms
   the state-of-the-art discovery mechanisms and significantly reduces the
   query response time by at least 77\%, while maintaining comparable
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The cloud computing paradigm enables the development of applications
   that can elastically react to changes in their environment by
   autonomously provisioning and releasing infrastructure resources.
   However, current applications need to be specifically tailored to a
   concrete cloud provider infrastructure, leading to vendor lock-in.
   Migrating applications to the cloud or between cloud providers is
   challenging due to differences in deployment directives, available
   services, and programming interfaces. Existing infrastructure as code
   approaches closely tie application artifacts to their deployment
   directives and do not allow for a clear separation of application
   artifacts from deployment infrastructure. In this paper, we present
   Smart Fabric, a methodology and accompanying toolset for
   infrastructure-agnostic deployment of application artifact topologies
   based on a constraint-based, declarative specification of the required
   deployment infrastructure. Our framework allows for seamless migration
   of application topologies between deployment targets and enables
   independent, parallel evolution of both, applications and underlying
   infrastructure. We discuss the feasibility of the proposed methodology
   and prototype implementation using representative applications from the
   Internet of Things and smart city domains.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, companies are increasingly adopting the technology of cloud
   computing. This technology allows them to innovate and to improve their
   business. Plus, the presence of numerous cloud providers would be
   beneficial for providers and companies if some collaboration among
   clouds will be achieved. This collaboration lets companies to choose and
   to move their applications and data among clouds without being tied to
   any provider. We have embedded the Service Component Architecture in the
   cloud computing domain. The proposed model aims at facilitating the data
   sharing between multiple cloud service providers regardless their
   infrastructure, tools and platforms. Indeed, we have opted for SCA
   standard to promote the interoperability mechanism by moving and
   converting data formats exchanged among clouds. Our model allows many
   providers to interact among each other by overcoming the syntactic
   heterogeneity in order to satisfy companies' needs.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing enables a new supplement of consumption and delivery
   model for internet based services and protocol. It helps to provide
   software, hardware and data in form of collaborative services on the
   demand of the end user. To meet the QoS and ensure high interoperability
   and scalability is one of the most challenging tasks for cloud service
   provider. However, there are also several technical challenges that need
   to be tackled before the benefits can be fully realized. Among them
   reliability, resource provisioning, and efficient resources consuming
   etc are major concern. Load balancing also one of them. It includes
   selecting a proper node that must be full filled end user demand and
   also distribution of dynamic workload evenly into the multiple nodes. So
   load balancing can be described as an optimization problem and should be
   adapting nature due to the changing needs. In this paper we suggest a
   novel load balancing strategy to search under loaded node to balance
   load from overwhelmed node. CloudAnalyst used as a simulation tool for
   the proposed load balancing strategy. Experimental results of the sample
   application are really very encouraging. Significantly the results of
   the proposed algorithm are compared and outperformed the traditional
   strategy like First Come First Serve(FCFS), local search algorithm like
   Stochastic Hill Climbing(SHC) and soft computing approaches like Genetic
   Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization(ACO).}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is familiar to all, as an innovative technology, as the
   new generation of the internet as a good opportunity for new ideas in
   business. It's a term that refers to sources and computer systems
   available on demand through the internet.
   Cloud computing is increasingly used for various needs and convenience.
   It can provide a number of integrated computer services without being
   bound by local resources in order to make it easier for the user, and
   those resources include data backup, storage space and
   self-synchronization. The adoption of cloud computing is not as complex
   as many organizations have thought and by moving the applications and
   hardware out of the organization the user can focus on its core
   strategies.
   The cloud-based model uses delivery of information technology services
   accessible through the network. Networks can be part of the internal
   infrastructure organizations - intranet, or external, such as the
   Internet or mobile networks. The use of internal networks and services
   is preferred by organizations - private Cloud. External networks and
   services offered by public cloud services pose significant risks. The
   main risks associated with public cloud computing are security and
   access control ( accessibility).
   Public cloud computing - offers attractive advantages to higher
   education, delivering infrastructure, services, and software on demand
   through the network. For example, it has the potential to reduce
   information and communications technology (IT) costs by virtualizing
   capital assets such as disk storage and processing cycles into a readily
   available, affordable operating expense. Sometimes selecting a public
   cloud offering can create risk around security, privacy,
   interoperability, or performance. When it does, universities should
   consider private cloud deployment models to realize scale on demand,
   rapid platform deployment, and lower costs and carbon emissions while
   minimizing risk.
   This paper aims to investigate Cloud Computing and discusses the drivers
   and inhibitors of its adoption, a review of different security issues
   like trust, confidentiality, authenticity, encryption, on how to
   overcome these issues.}},

Abstract = {{Many IT service platforms (e.g., cloud computing platforms) are built as
   closed systems. They do not allow their customers to interoperate with
   other platforms or port their data to other platforms. As switching to a
   different system is costly, customers of a closed IT system can be
   considered locked in. Consequently, potential customers, who are aware
   of this lock-in issue, do not adopt cloud services. Opening up an IT
   service platform, however, reduces users' concerns about lock-in and its
   associated switching cost. It is even predicted that an IT service
   platform gets more attractive, if it opens up. This paper validates this
   prediction by analyzing the level of openness (i.e., interoperability,
   portability, and usability) of cloud computing platforms on their
   adoption. For the validation, we develop a value creation model for IT
   service platforms. Based on this value creation model and a
   specification of requirements of open cloud computing platforms, the
   relationship between the openness of IT service platforms and the
   adoption of IT service platforms (i.e., attractiveness) is analyzed in
   detail. In particular, our results show that the level of openness plays
   a major role in the adoption of IT service platforms of emerging service
   providers. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The cloud computing paradigm encompasses several key differentiating
   elements and technologies, tackling a number of inefficiencies,
   limitations and problems that have been identified in the distributed
   and virtualized computing domain. Nonetheless, and as it is the case for
   all emerging technologies, their adoption led to the presentation of new
   challenges and new complexities. In this paper we present key
   application areas and capabilities of future scenarios, which are not
   tackled by current advancements and highlight specific requirements and
   goals for advancements in the cloud computing domain. We discuss these
   requirements and goals across different focus areas of cloud computing,
   ranging from cloud service and application integration, development
   environments and abstractions, to interoperability and relevant to it
   aspects such as legislation. The future application areas and their
   requirements are also mapped to the aforementioned areas in order to
   highlight their dependencies and potential for moving cloud technologies

Abstract = {{The smart data continuum refers to a series of increasingly semantically
   expressive definitions for data elements. With increased semantics we
   can achieve semantic interoperability, i.e., the ability of computer
   systems to exchange data with unambiguous and shared meaning. In context
   of smart homes it offers advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and
   services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications. In order to
   achieve semantic interoperability in smart homes we have developed Smart
   Home Ontology, which gives semantics for the data that are exchanged by
   the systems and devices in a smart home. From technology point of view,
   we have studied the combination of cloud computing and Internet of
   Things as they enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful
   processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual
   ``things{''}, thus stimulating innovations in both fields. Further, we
   will show how the principles of the Linked Data allow the integration of
   Smart Home data with other data sources, and thus increases the

Abstract = {{Network technologies have always been a crucial part of success for
   technologies like cloud computing. But due to the slow development of a
   scalable IT infrastructure, this can lead to issues in competitiveness.
   Software defined networking (SDN) can thereby counteract such issues by
   giving new functions to the whole network topology. With SDN,
   administrators have the possibility to abstract the underlying network
   infrastructure for applications and network services. The paper reports
   on the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on challenges and
   effects of SDN. It shows that most papers address the implementation of
   software defined networking as a challenge, including factors like
   vendor lock-in and the general risk of changing traditional network
   architectures. Attention is also given to security issues arising with
   software defined networks and the permanent high demand from the
   end-user combined with the fear of changing traditional networks. Issues
   dealing with specialized know-how were identified as another challenge
   category. Effects of SDN are discussed by defining unique features of
   SDN like decoupling hardware from the software and the global view of
   the whole network architecture. SDN furthermore affects the management
   of the network, including changes in deployment of policies, the
   programmability and maintenance of the network. Economic factors, such
   as cost efficiency and reduction of costs, are also discussed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Sensor technology and sensor networks have evolved so rapidly that they
   are now considered a core driver of the Internet of Things (IoT),
   however data analytics on IoT streams is still in its infancy. This
   paper introduces an approach to sensor data analytics by using the
   OpenIoT(1) middleware; real time event processing and clustering
   algorithms have been used for this purpose. The OpenIoT platform has
   been extended to support stream processing and thus we demonstrate its
   flexibility in enabling real time on-demand application domain
   analytics. We use mobile crowd-sensed data, provided in real time from
   wearable sensors, to analyse and infer air quality conditions. This
   experimental evaluation has been implemented using the design principles
   and methods for IoT data interoperability specified by the OpenIoT
   project. We describe an event and clustering analytics server that acts
   as an interface for novel analytical IoT services. The approach
   presented in this paper also demonstrates how sensor data acquired from
   mobile devices can be integrated within IoT platforms to enable
   analytics on data streams. It can be regarded as a valuable tool to
   understand complex phenomena, e. g., air pollution dynamics and its
   impact on human health.}},

   types of document format are moving towards separation of content and
   presentation, and therefore good interoperability is expected. We
   illustrate by example what the proposed mark-up language could look like
   and give an example to illustrate its use in transforming a sample
   HTML/CSS page into UOF. In the conclusion we note the importance of such

Abstract = {{With the growing popularity of cloud computing and large number of
   providers, it is necessary to select the most appropriate service. To
   select a suitable provider the user needs to browse a huge list of
   providers. To solve this problem, the customer can use a third-party
   service called a cloud broker. One of the problem we faced during the
   developing cloud broker framework is a lack of API standards. Every
   provider has its own protocol for deploying services. This paper
   describes a new approach to construct a protocol for communication
   between the client and the provider. It is based on the use of
   mediators, which, depending on the selected service capable to convert
   messages from a format of one particular provider to a format of another
   provider. All the processes described in a specific example of Google
   Compute Engine client and Digital Ocean server interactions for
   deploying the service. In addition, during the development of mediators
   was introduced a new operator `` sync{''} to synchronize the set of
   answers to one.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing platforms offer diverse services and capabilities with
   own features. Hence, the provider services could be used by end users to
   compose a heterogeneous context of multiple cloud platforms in order to
   deploy their cloud applications made up of a set of modules, according
   to the best capabilities of the cloud providers. However, this is an
   ideal scenario, since the cloud platforms are being conducted in an
   isolated way by presenting many interoperability and portability
   restrictions, which complicate the integration of diverse provider
   services to achieve an heterogeneous deployment of multi-cloud
   applications. In this ongoing work, we present an approach based on
   model transformation to deploy multi-cloud applications by reusing
   standardization efforts related to the management and deployment of
   cloud applications. Specifically, using mechanisms specified by both
   standards, TOSCA and CAMP, we propose a methodology to describe the
   topology and distribution of modules of a cloud application and to
   deploy the interconnected modules over heterogeneous clouds. We
   illustrate our idea using a running example.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is moving from being a testing ground for isolated
   projects to being a strategic approach of the entire business
   organization. So the choice among the possible cloud offers, with a
   strong focus on the choice of services that enable better processes and
   projects of the business lines, is gaining importance. Nevertheless the
   heterogeneity of the Cloud services, resources, technology and service
   levels offered by the several providers make difficult to decide.
   Besides the inconveniences caused by the ``lock-in{''}, give rise to the
   need for developers to be able to develop an application regardless of
   where it is released, structuring and building it in a vendor agnostic
   way so that it is possible to deploy on the provider that best fits them
   at the moment. The mOSAIC project aims at designing and developing an
   innovative open-source API and platform that enables applications to be
   Cloud providers' neutral and to negotiate Cloud services as requested by
   their users, allowing automatic discovery, matchmaking, and thus
   supporting selection, brokering, interoperability end even composition
   of Cloud Services among multiple Clouds. In this paper, we illustrate
   the interoperation of the two components, the Semantic Engine and the
   Cloud Agency for the agnostic retrieval, discovery and brokering of
   cloud services. The focus will be put on the way to support the Cloud
   Application Developer to express the requirements and services/resources
   in vendor agnostic way and to translate automatically these requirements
   into a neutral format in order to compare it with the different offers
   of providers and to broker the best one according to defined policies.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaping to a worldwide network of
   networks consisting of billions of interconnected heterogeneous
   sensor/actuator-equipped devices (denoted as ``things{''} or ``smart
   objects{''}), which are expected to exceed 50 billions by 2020. Smart
   objects, which will be pervasively deployed, are constrained devices
   with (i) limited processing power and available memory and (ii) limited
   communication capabilities, in terms of transmission rate and
   reliability. Future Smart-X applications, such as Smart Cities and Home
   Automation, will be fostered by the use of standard and interoperable
   IP-based communication protocols that smart objects are going to
   implement, by simplifying their development, integration, and
   deployment. Smart-X applications will significantly differ from
   traditional Internet services, in terms of: (i) the number of data
   sources; (ii) rate of information exchange; and, (iii) need for
   real-time processing. Because of these requirements, such services are
   denoted as ``Big Stream{''} applications, in order to distinguish them
   from traditional Big Data applications. In this paper, we present an
   implementation of a novel Cloud architecture for Big Stream applications
   based on standard protocols and open-source components, which provides a
   scalable and efficient processing platform for IoT applications,
   designed to be open and extensible and to guarantee minimal latency
   between data generation and consumption. We also provide a performance
   evaluation based on experimentation in a real-world Smart Parking
   scenario, to assess the feasibility and scalability of the proposed
   architecture.}},

   come with many advantages, but also raised issues regarding the
   security, availability and reliability of the Smart Grid. The data
   generated by the Smart Grid's systems has the properties of a time

   this paper, cloud computing has become a real candidate for Smart Grid
   data analysis. We present the particularities of the data generated in
   the Smart Grid and the operations involved in its analysis. As well we

Abstract = {{During the past few years, cloud computing has become a key IT buzzword.
   A growing number of cloud providers started to expose their own services
   to the market, to answer consumer's need, engaging a competition in the
   attempt to offer the easiest access to resources and the widest
   catalogue of services. However, the current lack of a shared standard
   for the description of such services can represent an obstacle to the
   development of interoperable and portable cloud solutions. In this
   scenario, developers could benefit from an automatic tool or technique
   to identify the architectural solution best answering their requests. In
   this work we are presenting our approach to the semantic description of
   cloud resources, comprehending both a general and agnostic
   representation of such services and a focus on provider specific
   solutions. Also, we illustrate how the proposed description can be
   queried and further extended, by means of logical rules, in order to

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has been introduced as a solution to several problems of
   the traditional web-based e-learning system, such as a limited storage,
   a high infrastructure maintenance costs and a low interoperability among
   the component of web-based e-learning system. However, the cloud
   computing system performance may deteriorate with increasing number of
   users and become worse when many users access the video streaming from
   the cloud system. This is due to the centralized architecture of the
   cloud computing that can generate network traffic congestion and
   bottleneck in the cloud servers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture has
   been proposed to overcome this problem. Using P2P, all nodes in the
   cloud system can act as servers as well as clients at the same time for
   reducing the congestion and bottleneck of the system. Currently, there
   are few reviews on P2P video streaming although intensive studies have
   been done on the development of the system. With this condition,
   identifying and understanding the development of P2P video streaming
   will be expensive, time consuming and physically exhausting. The
   objective of this paper is to review the latest development of P2P video
   streaming based on cloud computing. A narrative review method has been
   used as the methodology for investigating the P2P video streaming'
   articles from 2009 to 2014. The outcomes of this research shows that
   90\% of cloud based e-learning integrate with P2P when it's involving
   streaming video. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This

Abstract = {{Ontology matching is among the core techniques used for integration and
   interoperability resolution between biomedical systems. However, due to
   the excess usage and ever-evolving nature of biomedical data, ontologies
   are becoming large-scale, and complex; consequently, requiring scalable
   computational environments with performance and availability in mind. In
   this paper, we present a cloud-based ontology matching system for
   biomedical ontologies that provides ontology matching as a service. Our
   proposed system implements parallelism at various levels to improve the
   overall ontology matching performance especially for large-scale
   biomedical ontologies and incorporates third-party resources UMLS and
   Wordnet for comprehensive matched results. Matched results are delivered
   to the service consumer as bridge ontology and preserved in ubiquitous
   ontology repository for future request. We evaluate our system by
   consuming the matching service in an interoperability engine of a
   clinical decision support system (CDSS), which generates mapping
   requests for FMA and NCI biomedical ontologies.}},

Abstract = {{Federated Identity Management (FIM) systems are well-known for achieving
   reliable and effective collaboration among various organizations.
   Despite numerous benefits, these systems have certain critical
   weaknesses such as lack of security and privacy while disseminating
   identity credentials (Personally Identifiable Information (PII)) across
   multiple federated Cloud environments. In addition to this, FIM systems
   have limitations in terms of interoperability and lack compliance to
   international standards, since most of the systems are reliant on
   proprietary protocols for the exchange of identity information. In this
   regard, we propose a secure identity management system for federated
   Cloud environments that not only ensures the secure management of
   identity credentials, but preserves the privacy of Cloud Service
   Consumers (CSC) also. Furthermore, implementation of the proposed system
   involves state-of-the-art international standards (SCIM, SAML, REST and
   XACML) to ensure secure, quick and easy sharing \& management of
   identity credentials in to, out of and around the Cloud. Further, we
   have performed rigorous evaluation of the proposed system using standard
   evaluation tools such as Scyther and JUnit. The results of our
   evaluation certify that the presented work ensures the desired features
   and level of security as expected from a secure identity management
   system for federated Cloud environment.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of Cloud Computing technologies by the organizations has
   profound consequences on the way software applications are developed and
   used. The migration to the Cloud may be accompanied by the revision of
   the business process, to integrate tasks over big data. In this way,
   existing workflow implementations may be extended with calls to
   operations in Hadoop or other tools. In this work, we define a framework
   to implement business process over heterogeneous technologies. Our
   framework is based on a novel workflow engine, called BP-AM. Workflow
   execution in mu BP-AM is performed by successively transforming the
   graph obtained from a workflow definition. BP-AM has a formal semantics,
   which gives a precise definition of how the workflow is implemented. mu
   BP-AM is at the core of an extensible framework capable of supporting
   not only Web service operations but also Hadoop operation calls (among
   others). The tool described here was conceived to increase reliability
   and to promote interoperability. We describe a prototype implementation
   of our framework, as well as some experimental results. Experiments
   using this prototype show that compositions run in BP-AM using about the
   same resources as those run by using other tools.}},

Abstract = {{The Virtual Hazards Impact \& Risk Laboratory (VHIRL) is a scientific
   workflow portal that provides researchers with access to a cloud
   computing environment for natural hazards eResearch tools. It allows
   researchers to construct experiments with data from a variety of sources
   and execute cloud computing processes for rapid and remote simulation
   and analysis. The service currently includes tools for the simulation of
   three major hazards affecting the Asia-Pacific region: earthquakes,
   tsunamis and tropical cyclones.
   For scientific results, the establishment of provenance is key to
   reproducibility and trust. Thus the need for any virtual laboratory to
   provide provenance information for the tasks it manages is obvious, but
   the appropriate way to report and manage provenance information is not
   always so straightforward.
   Many virtual laboratories and workflow systems provide bespoke
   provenance management with a focus on internal system use. This has
   clear benefits for reproducibility within the system, but it limits the
   interoperability of systems. For VHIRL, a provenance solution was
   required that was as interoperable with other, external, provenance
   systems as possible.
   A related common issue facing workflow tools and virtual laboratories is
   the need to manage software code. With this comes well-known issues
   associated with code sharing: licensing, source code management, version
   management and dependency resolution. There are a wide selection of
   commonly used tools to help solve these problems, for example Git and
   Subversion.
   A key goal of VHIRL was to externalise as much information management as
   was reasonable. VHIRL is a virtual laboratory: it is not designed to be
   a data store, software repository, or records management system. A
   solution was required that could hand off the management of provenance
   records and code to external services, with links between them, other
   data services and VHIRL jobs where appropriate.
   Scientific software can be quite complicated and systems for managing
   dependencies and source vary from system to system. In order to provide
   the least friction for authors of software, we designed a system called
   the Scientific Software Solution Centre (SSSC) to manage solutions to
   scientific problems and deliver the solution templates, code and
   dependencies that enable them for use in VHIRL and other Virtual
   Laboratories and applications.
   We discuss our integration of the PROMS provenance toolkit into VHIRL in
   order to generate standardised provenance reports according to the W3C's
   PROV ontology. We describe the collection of provenance information
   through the VHIRL service and the submission of that information to an
   external provenance system. We also present the SSSC design as an
   example of how to meet the disparate requirements of managing scientific
   codes and solutions while dealing with publishing, discovery, licensing
   and versioning. We show how the SSSC assists in provenance report
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{Modern digital technologies are paving the path to a revolutionary new
   concept of health and wellness care. Nowadays, many new solutions are
   being released and put at the reach of most consumers for promoting
   their health and wellness self-management. However, most of these
   applications are of very limited use, arguable accuracy and scarce
   interoperability with other similar systems. Accordingly, frameworks
   that may orchestrate, and intelligently leverage, all the data,
   information and knowledge generated through these systems are
   particularly required. This work introduces Mining Minds, an innovative
   framework that builds on some of the most prominent modern digital
   technologies, such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Internet of Things,
   to enable the provision of personalized healthcare and wellness support.
   This paper aims at describing the efficient and rational combination and
   interoperation of these technologies, as well as their integration with
   current and future personalized health and wellness services and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION NETWORKS AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{19-39}},
Abstract = {{Service level agreements (SLAs) are used to bind cloud provider for
   providing services and hence to assure cloud consumer that delivered
   services are up to the mark. However, most of the cloud SLAs are either
   static in nature or are concerned only for availability of service
   leaving major concerns such as performance, security, metering and
   monitoring, automation, and many more. In this paper, we have reviewed
   the existing SLA frameworks and then examined their suitability in the
   context of cloud computing. Next, we discuss the desirable components,
   which should be considered in cloud SLA. Also, we have identified
   different parameters that need to be incorporated in each component.
   Based on this, we put forward a cloud SLA template, which we termed as
   cloud service level agreement template (CSLAT). This work attempts to
   provide a clear and formal definition of decisive parameters in cloud
   computing. The definition will give clear perception of how these
   parameters should be specified in SLA, so as to avoid any conflict
   rising due to ambiguity in it. Further, precise monitoring and QoS
   measurement can be done using the mathematical interpretations given
   corresponding to parameters. Thus, proposed CSLAT will help in
   automation of SLA management in cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has made the use of IT services more accessible and
   cheap. Resources are easily configurable and accessible using networked
   client devices and are characterised by particular agility and
   efficiency of use that allows to scale dynamically and on demand.
   However, owing to the current lack of standards and to the heterogeneity
   of technologies, users have little flexibility in choosing from
   alternative providers simultaneously in order to optimise resources at
   different levels so being affected by the vendor lock-in problem. In
   this paper, we address the problem of interoperability at IaaS level by
   proposing an agent abstraction, the vendor agent that is a wrapper to a
   specific provider technology, and its implementation to support two
   well-known cloud platforms: Open Nebula and Amazon. This abstraction
   represents a key driver towards interoperability giving users the
   opportunity to choose and use services provided by many different cloud
   vendors.}},

Abstract = {{With the massive adoption of cloud computing, a growing number of small
   and medium enterprises (SMEs) now have the opportunity, together with
   the immediate goal of reducing cost, to effectively expose their
   services or group themselves into clusters or virtual enterprises in
   order to build and expose customised offerings. Different requirements,
   ranging from interoperability and portability, provisioning and
   reconfiguration, security and privacy, or monitoring and auditing, can
   all be controlled through the lifecycle support of cloud services and
   grouped under the umbrella of different virtual enterprises. A semantic
   support is essential to enable such an entity, and to foster
   collaboration among different virtual enterprises by providing specific
   mechanisms by which the construction of complex services from elementary
   building blocks can be made possible. At the same time it actively
   supports tasks like automation of cloud resource usage, efficient
   monitoring and scaling of cloud services, either individually or based
   on specific dependencies, or replacement and termination of services
   when the initial offers are no longer available.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{78-90}},
Abstract = {{Cloud technology has provided much more effective and flexible
   management of computing infrastructure both to service vendors and
   customers. However, the provisioning of computing resources and
   deployment of applications using heterogeneous infrastructure as a
   service (IaaS) clouds is not straight forward, because offers are not
   easily comparable, providers ask for using different technologies and a
   standard is still lacking. Moreover cloud providers often hinder the
   adoption of a common standard in order to lock customers to their
   solutions. To address these issues we have designed and developed,
   within the research activities of the mOSAIC project, an agents-based
   solution that provides a uniform interface to IaaS provisioning and
   management. The Cloud Agency uses a set of vendor agents implementing
   adapters to different commercial cloud providers and open source cloud
   technologies. Starting from the computational constraints and from the
   application requirements, the vendor agents allow the users to negotiate
   the best IaaS solution that is available in the cloud market and to
   build and deploy his/her cloud infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Disaster management that uses web-based technology to enhance user

   the `Riskr' project, which applies a low-technological solution to
   creating a disaster portal fed by social networking messages. The system
   has been implemented using Twitter and tested by users to determine the
   feasibility. Results suggest the combination of online services and
   interoperability between disaster portals; and social networks can
   further enhance disaster management initiatives as 70.5\% of the users

Abstract = {{Cloud manufacturing is emerging as a novel business paradigm for the
   manufacturing industry, in which dynamically scalable and virtualised
   resources are provided as consumable services over the Internet. A
   handful of cloud manufacturing systems are proposed for different
   business scenarios, most of which fall into one of three deployment
   modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud, and public cloud. One of the
   challenges in the existing solutions is that few of them are capable of
   adapting to changes in the business environment. In fact, different
   companies may have different cloud requirements in different business
   situations; even a company at different business stages may need
   different cloud modes. Nevertheless, there is limited support on
   migrating to different cloud modes in existing solutions. This paper
   proposes a Hybrid Manufacturing Cloud that allows companies to deploy
   different cloud modes for their periodic business goals. Three typical
   cloud modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud and public cloud are
   supported in the system. Furthermore, it enables companies to set
   self-defined access rules for each resource so that unauthorised
   companies will not have access to the resource. This self-managed
   mechanism gives companies full control of their businesses and boosts
   their trust with enhanced privacy protection. A unified ontology is
   developed to enhance semantic interoperability throughout the whole
   process of service provision in the clouds. A Cloud Management Engine is
   developed to manage all the user-defined clouds, in which Semantic Web
   technologies are used as the main toolkit. The feasibility of this
   approach is verified through a group of companies, each of which has
   complex access requirements for their resources. In addition, a use case
   is carried out between customers and service providers. This way,
   optimal service is delivered through the proposed system., (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The advent of Cloud Computing opened new opportunities in several areas,
   namely in the application development processes. As consequence,
   nowadays, PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) service model allows simpler and
   flexible deployment strategies of applications, avoiding the need for
   dedicated networks, servers, storage, and other services. Within this
   context, several PaaS providers exist in the market, but each one having
   specific characteristics, proprietary technologies and Application
   Programming Interfaces (APIs). Based on such assumptions, this work
   addresses the challenge of devising a PaaS aggregation solution with the
   objective of unifying the information and management processes of
   applications created in PaaS environments. The proposed solution,
   denominated as PaaS Manager, take the form of a PaaS API aggregator
   ahning to struggle the existing lock-in in the PaaS market. In this
   perspective, this paper describes the specification, development and
   test of the proposed PaaS Manager solution. As result of this framework,
   end-users are able to select the most appropriate PaaS platform for an
   application, interacting with any supported vendor through a unique
   deployment and management interface.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud data centers are becoming the preferred deployment environment for
   a wide range of business applications because they provide many benefits
   compared to private in-house infrastructure. However, the traditional
   approach of using a single cloud has several limitations in terms of
   availability, avoiding vendor lock-in, and providing
   legislation-compliant services with suitable Quality of Experience (QoE)
   to users worldwide. One way for cloud clients to mitigate these issues
   is to use multiple clouds (i.e., a Multi-Cloud). In this article, we
   introduce an approach for deploying three-tier applications across
   multiple clouds in order to satisfy their key nonfunctional
   requirements. We propose adaptive, dynamic, and reactive resource
   provisioning and load distribution algorithms that heuristically
   optimize overall cost and response delays without violating essential
   legislative and regulatory requirements. Our simulation with realistic
   workload, network, and cloud characteristics shows that our method
   improves the state of the art in terms of availability, regulatory
   compliance, and QoE with acceptable sacrifice in cost and latency.}},

Abstract = {{Body area networks (BANs) are emerging as enabling technology for many
   human-centered application domains such as health-care, sport, fitness,
   wellness, ergonomics, emergency, safety, security, and sociality. A BAN,
   which basically consists of wireless wearable sensor nodes usually
   coordinated by a static or mobile device, is mainly exploited to monitor
   single assisted livings. Data generated by a BAN can be processed in
   real-time by the BAN coordinator and/or transmitted to a server-side for
   online/offline processing and long-term storing. A network of BANs worn
   by a community of people produces large amount of contextual data that
   require a scalable and efficient approach for elaboration and storage.
   Cloud computing can provide a flexible storage and processing
   infrastructure to perform both online and offline analysis of body
   sensor data streams. In this paper, we motivate the introduction of
   Cloud-assisted BANs along with the main challenges that need to be
   addressed for their development and management. The current
   state-of-the-art is overviewed and framed according to the main
   requirements for effective Cloud-assisted BAN architectures. Finally,
   relevant open research issues in terms of efficiency, scalability,
   security, interoperability, prototyping, dynamic deployment and
   management, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In cloud computing environments in software as a service (SaaS) level,
   interoperability refers to the ability of SaaS systems on one cloud
   provider to communicate with SaaS systems on another cloud provider. One
   of the most important barriers to the adoption of SaaS systems in cloud
   computing environments is interoperability. A common tactic for enabling
   interoperability is the use of an interoperability framework or model.
   During the past few years, in cloud SaaS level, various interoperability
   frameworks and models have been developed to provide interoperability
   between systems. The syntactic interoperability of SaaS systems have
   already been intensively researched. However, not enough consideration
   has been given to semantic interoperability issues. Achieving semantic
   interoperability is a challenge within the world of SaaS in cloud
   computing environments. Therefore, a semantic interoperability framework
   for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments is needed. We develop a
   semantic interoperability framework for cloud SaaS systems. The
   capabilities and value of service oriented architecture for semantic
   interoperability within cloud SaaS systems have been studied and
   demonstrated. This paper is accomplished through a number of steps
   (research methodology). It begins with a study on related works in the
   literature. Then, problem statement and research objectives are
   explained. In the next step, semantic interoperability requirements for
   SaaS systems in cloud computing environments that are needed to support
   are analyzed. The details of the proposed semantic interoperability
   framework for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments are
   presented. It includes the design of the proposed semantic
   interoperability framework. Finally, the evaluation methods of the
   semantic interoperability framework are elaborated. In order to evaluate
   the effectiveness of the proposed semantic interoperability framework
   for SaaS systems in cloud computing environments, extensive
   experimentation and statistical analysis have been performed. The
   experiments and statistical analysis specify that the proposed semantic
   interoperability framework for cloud SaaS systems is able to establish
   semantic interoperability between cloud SaaS systems in a more efficient
   way. It is concluded that using the proposed framework, there is a
   significant improvement in the effectiveness of semantic
   interoperability of SaaS systems in cloud computing environments. (C)

Abstract = {{A brief review of the Internet history reveals the fact that the
   Internet evolved after the formation of primarily independent networks.
   Similarly, interconnected clouds, also called Inter-cloud, can be viewed
   as a natural evolution of cloud computing. Recent studies show the
   benefits in utilizing multiple clouds and present attempts for the
   realization of an Inter-cloud or federated cloud environment. However,
   cloud vendors have not taken into account cloud interoperability issues,
   and each cloud comes with its own solution and interfaces for services.
   This survey initially discusses all the relevant aspects motivating
   cloud interoperability. Furthermore, it categorizes and identifies
   possible cloud interoperability scenarios and architectures. The
   spectrum of challenges and obstacles that the Inter-cloud realization is
   faced with are covered, a taxonomy of them is provided, and fitting
   enablers that tackle each challenge are identified. All these aspects
   require a comprehensive review of the state of the art, including
   ongoing projects and studies in the area. We conclude by discussing
   future directions and trends toward the holistic approach in this
   regard.}},

Abstract = {{The interoperability of services and the sharing of health data have
   been a continuous goal for health professionals, patients, institutions,
   and policy makers. However, several issues have been hindering this
   goal, such as incompatible implementations of standards (e.g., HL7,
   DICOM), multiple ontologies, and security constraints. Cross-enterprise
   document sharing (XDS) workflows were proposed by Integrating the
   Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) to address current limitations in exchanging
   clinical data among organizations. To ensure data protection, XDS actors
   must be placed in trustworthy domains, which are normally inside such
   institutions. However, due to rapidly growing IT requirements, the
   outsourcing of resources in the Cloud is becoming very appealing. This
   paper presents a software proxy that enables the outsourcing of XDS
   architectural parts while preserving the interoperability,
   confidentiality, and searchability of clinical information. A key
   component in our architecture is a new searchable encryption (SE)
   scheme-Posterior Playfair Searchable Encryption (PPSE)-which, besides
   keeping the same confidentiality levels of the stored data, hides the
   search patterns to the adversary, bringing improvements when compared to
   the remaining practical state-of-the-art SE schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is arising as a prominent research area
   that is seeking to bring the massive advantages of the cloud to the
   constrained smartphones. Mobile devices are looking towards cloud-aware
   techniques, driven by their growing interest to provide ubiquitous
   PC-like functionality to mobile users. These functionalities mainly
   target at increasing storage and computational capabilities. Smartphones
   may integrate those functionalities from different cloud levels, in a
   service oriented manner within the mobile applications, so that a mobile
   task can be delegated by direct invocation of a service. However,
   developing these kind of mobile cloud applications requires to integrate
   and consider multiple aspects of the clouds, such as resource-intensive
   processing, programmatically provisioning of resources (Web APIs) and
   cloud intercommunication. To overcome these issues, we have developed a
   Mobile Cloud Middleware (MCM) framework, which addresses the issues of
   interoperability across multiple clouds, asynchronous delegation of
   mobile tasks and dynamic allocation of cloud infrastructure. MCM also
   fosters the integration and orchestration of mobile tasks delegated with
   minimal data transfer. A prototype of MCM is developed and several
   applications are demonstrated in different domains. To verify the
   scalability of MCM, load tests are also performed on the hybrid cloud
   resources. The detailed performance analysis of the middleware framework
   shows that MCM improves the quality of service for mobiles and helps in
   maintaining soft-real time responses for mobile cloud applications. (C)

Abstract = {{The Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platform (CBRAIN) is a web-based
   collaborative research platform developed in response to the challenges
   raised by data-heavy, compute-intensive neuroimaging research. CBRAIN
   offers transparent access to remote data sources, distributed computing
   sites, and an array of processing and visualization tools within a
   controlled, secure environment. Its web interface is accessible through
   any modern browser and uses graphical interface idioms to reduce the
   technical expertise required to perform large-scale computational
   analyses. CBRAIN's flexible meta-scheduling has allowed the
   incorporation of a wide range of heterogeneous computing sites,
   currently including nine national research High Performance Computing
   (HPC) centers in Canada, one in Korea, one in Germany, and several local
   research servers. CBRAIN leverages remote computing cycles and
   facilitates resource-interoperability in a transparent manner for the
   end-user. Compared with typical grid solutions available, our
   architecture was designed to be easily extendable and deployed on
   existing remote computing sites with no tool modification,
   administrative intervention, or special software/hardware configuration.
   As October 2013, CBRAIN serves over 200 users spread across 53 cities in
   17 countries. The platform is built as a generic framework that can
   accept data and analysis tools from any discipline. However, its current
   focus is primarily on neuroimaging research and studies of neurological
   diseases such as Autism, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, Multiple
   Sclerosis as well as on normal brain structure and development. This
   technical report presents the CBRAIN Platform, its current deployment
   and usage and future direction.}},

   important up to date computing concept for NE, as it offers significant
   financial and technical advantages beside high-level collaboration
   possibilities. As cloud computing is a new concept the solutions for
   handling interoperability, portability, security, privacy and
   standardization challenges have not been solved fully yet. The paper
   introduces the main characteristics of future Internet-based enterprises
   and the different CC models. An overview is given on interoperability
   and actual standardization issues in CC environments. A taxonomy on
   possible connecting forms of networked enterprises and cloud-based IT
   systems with reference on interoperability is introduced, parallel
   presenting four use cases as well. Finally, an example of connecting
   cloud and NE is presented as an effective application of cloud computing
   in manufacturing industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced manufacturing industries demand the embedded computer numerical
   control system having less vendor and hardware dependencies and more
   powerful computing capacity and intelligence. It is very important to
   build such an embedded computer numerical control system, and
   fortunately, PLCopen standard combined with Cloud Computing brings a
   brand new opportunity. Hence, this article presents an approach to
   fulfill those requirements based on PLCopen standard and Cloud
   Computing. A novel architecture of the embedded computer numerical
   control system is proposed, and the characteristics of the embedded
   computer numerical control system are discussed. The PLCopen standard is
   charged of real-time motion control, offering interoperability,
   feasibility, simplicity, and universality characteristics. The Cloud
   Computing technology is used to improve the system performance and to
   extend functions, overcoming the problem that the intelligence
   requirement is not compatible with limited hardware resource. A thermal
   error compensation experiment is described to illustrate the embedded
   computer numerical control system, and the result demonstrates that the
   PLCopen standard and Cloud Computing technology can be perfectly applied
   to the embedded computer numerical control system.}},

Abstract = {{Good physical fitness generally makes the body less prone to common
   diseases. A personalized exercise plan that promotes a balanced approach
   to fitness helps promotes fitness, while inappropriate forms of exercise
   can have adverse consequences for health. This paper aims to develop an

   exercise plans based on a user's profile and health status,
   incorporating international standard Health Level Seven International
   (HL7) data on physical fitness and health screening. The generated plan
   exposing Representational State Transfer (REST) style web services which
   can be accessed from any Internet-enabled device and deployed in cloud
   computing environments. To ensure the practicality of the generated
   exercise plans, encapsulated knowledge used as a basis for inference in
   the system is acquired from domain experts. The proposed Ubiquitous
   Exercise Plan Generation for Personalized Physical Fitness (UFIT) will
   not only improve health-related fitness through generating personalized

Abstract = {{The pervasive availability of cheap cloud computing services for data
   storage, either as persistence layer to applications or as mere object
   store dedicated to final users, is remarkably increasing the chance that
   cloud platforms potentially host evidence of criminal activity. Once
   presented a proper court order, cloud providers would be in the best
   position for extracting relevant data from their platforms in the most
   reliable and complete way. However, this kind of services are not so
   widespread to date and, therefore, the need to adopt a structured and
   forensically sound approach calls for innovative weaponry which leverage
   the data harvesting capabilities offered by the low level program
   interfaces exposed by providers. This paper describes the concepts and
   internals of the Cloud Data Imager Library, a mediation layer that
   offers a read only access to files and metadata of selected remote
   folders and currently supports access to Dropbox, Google Drive and
   Microsoft Skydrive storage facilities. A demo application has been build
   on top of the library which allows directory browsing, file content view
   and imaging of folder trees with export to widespread forensic formats.

Abstract = {{In the last years, many institutions have provided themselves with
   cluster and Grid infrastructures either for intensive computation or
   research objectives. Each infrastructure having its own and different
   management operating software, the integration of different platforms
   becomes a hard and complicated task. Solving the interoperability
   problem for a set of different computing infrastructures belonging to
   our institution in order to solve a computation intensive problem was
   our objective. The paper describes the solution that was applied and the
   experimental results obtained. The solution uses a platform based on a
   central bus shared by the involved system components for information
   exchange. In order to ensure that all computations will succeed, the
   solution includes cloud infrastructures to deal with situations in which
   the local computing resources pose some problems. Also a cloud based
   solution for the bus deployment is explored and empirically compared
   with a local deployment.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of virtualized and distributed infrastructures has led to new
   challenges to accomplish the effective use of compute resources through
   the design and orchestration of distributed applications. As legacy,
   monolithic applications are replaced with service-oriented applications,
   questions arise about the steps to be taken in order to maximize the
   usefulness of the infrastructures and to provide users with tools for
   the development and execution of distributed applications. One of the
   issues to be solved is the existence of multiple cloud solutions that
   are not interoperable, which forces the user to be locked to a specific
   provider or to continuously adapt applications. With the objective of
   simplifying the programmers challenges, ServiceSs provides a
   straightforward programming model and an execution framework that helps
   on abstracting applications from the actual execution environment. This
   paper presents how ServiceSs transparently interoperates with multiple
   providers implementing the appropriate interfaces to execute scientific

Abstract = {{The submission and management of computational jobs is a traditional
   part of utility computing environments. End users and developers of
   domain-specific software abstractions often have to deal with the
   heterogeneity of such batch processing systems. This lead to a number of
   application programming interface and job description standards in the
   past, which are implemented and established for cluster and Grid
   systems. With the recent rise of cloud computing as new utility
   computing paradigm, the standardized access to batch processing
   facilities operated on cloud resources becomes an important issue.
   Furthermore, the design of such a standard has to consider a tradeoff
   between feature completeness and the achievable level of
   interoperability. The article discusses this general challenge, and
   presents some existing standards with traditional cluster and Grid
   computing background that may be applicable to cloud environments. We
   present OCCI-DRMAA as one approach for standardized access to batch
   processing facilities hosted in a cloud.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing and Service Oriented Architectures have seen a dramatic
   increase of the amount of applications, services, management platforms,
   data, etc. gaining momentum for the necessity of new complex methods and
   techniques to deal with the vast heterogeneity of data sources or
   services. In this sense Quality of Service (QoS) seeks for providing an
   intelligent environment of self-management components based on domain
   knowledge in which cloud components can be optimized easing the
   transition to an advanced governance environment. On the other hand,
   semantics and ontologies have emerged to afford a common and standard
   data model that eases the interoperability, integration and monitoring
   of knowledge-based systems. Taking into account the necessity of an
   interoperable and intelligent system to manage QoS in cloud-based
   systems and the emerging application of semantics in different domains,
   this paper reviews the main approaches for semantic-based QoS management
   as well as the principal methods, techniques and standards for
   processing and exploiting diverse data providing advanced real-time
   monitoring services. A semantic-based framework for QoS management is
   also outlined taking advantage of semantic technologies and distributed
   datastream processing techniques. Finally a discussion of existing
   efforts and challenges is also provided to suggest future directions.

Abstract = {{Data semantics play an extremely significant role in spatial data
   infrastructures by providing semantic specifications to geospatial data
   and enabling in this way data sharing and interoperability. By applying,
   on the fly, composite geospatial processes on the above data it is
   possible to produce valuable geoinformation over the web directly
   available and applicable to a wide range of geo-activities of
   significant importance for the research and industry community. Cloud
   computing may enable geospatial processing since it refers to, among
   other things, efficient computing resources providing on demand
   processing services. In this context, we attempt to provide a design and
   architectural framework for web applications based on open geospatial
   standards. Our approach includes, in addition to geospatial processing,
   data acquisition services that are essential especially when dealing
   with satellite images and applications in the area of remote sensing and
   similar fields. As a result, by putting in a common framework all data
   and geoprocesses available in the Cloud, it is possible to combine the
   appropriate services in order to produce a solution for a specific need.

   computing environments}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{257}},
Pages = {{231-247}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Services are expected to be a promising way for people to use
   information and computing resources in our emerging ubiquitous network
   society and cloud computing environments. In this study, we propose a
   metaphoric concept called a flowable service. It is defined as a logical
   stream that organizes and provides circumjacent services in such a way
   that they are perceived by individuals to be naturally embedded in their
   surrounding environments. We present our view on how some of these
   problems, such as the flexibility, portability and interoperability of
   services, can be solved using flowable services in order to provide a
   seamless integration of diverse services in the most intuitive
   ``flowable{''} way possible, thus achieving maximum satisfaction for
   both service providers and consumers while decreasing the delivery cost
   of the services. Recognizing the importance of the awareness of each
   individual's context for a smooth and accurate provision of services, we
   further propose a human-centric framework for context-aware flowable
   services, which harnesses the users' contexts to enable a pro-active
   support of human activities in a flexible and natural way. Owing to
   context-awareness, this framework can find and integrate circumjacent
   services that are considered needed by each individual and can create an
   ambient service environment that is tailored to his/her specific needs,
   proclivities and characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Smart Grid has been characterized as the next generation power grid in
   which modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) will
   improve control, reliability and safety. Although the adoption of
   generic off-the-shelf ICT in Smart Grid provisions indisputable
   advantages and benefits, it raises several issues concerning the
   reliability and security of communications - the core infrastructure of
   Smart Grid. Cloud computing has developed and evolved over the past
   years becoming a real choice for Smart Grids infrastructure because of
   the availability, scalability, performance and interoperability that it
   offers. In this paper we present a survey of the existing cloud-based
   software platforms for implementing secure Smart Grids. Security issues
   like authentication and authorization of users, data encryption,
   availability, attacker impact, detection and trust management have
   received significant attention in previous work. Nevertheless, as shown
   in this paper, their integration and adaptation to emerging fields such
   as Smart Grid is still in an embryonic state. As such, we report recent
   advancements and software platforms specifically for Smart Grid and we
   outline several issues as well as suggestions for designing
   security-aware platforms for Smart Grid.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has been one of the most important topics in IT which
   aims to assure scalable and reliable on-demand services over the
   Internet. The expansion of the application scope of cloud services would
   require cooperation between clouds from different providers that have
   heterogeneous functionalities. However, current cloud systems do not
   fully support inter-cloud interoperability and require more research
   work to provide sufficient functions to enable that seamless
   collaboration between cloud services. This paper proposes an efficient
   model for selecting appropriate computing resource from multi-cloud
   providers that is required to achieve inter-cloud interoperability in a
   heterogeneous Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud environment. The
   goal of the model is dispatching the workload on the most effective
   clouds available at runtime offering the best performance at the least
   cost. We consider that each job can have six requirements: CPU, memory,
   network bandwidth, serving time, maximum possible waiting time, and the
   priority based on the agreed Service Level Agreement (SLA) contract and
   service price. Additionally, we assume the SLA contract with suitable
   criteria between cloud-subscriber and multiple IaaS cloud-providers is
   signed beforehand. This computing resource selection model is based on
   Genetic Algorithm (GA). The resource selection model is evaluated using
   agent based model simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Vendor lock-in and cloud outages are two important challenges that make
   IT managers reluctant in widely adopting the cloud within the
   enterprise. Vendor lock-in happens when the adoption of cloud
   provider-specific technologies and APIs forces consumers to stay with
   the same provider even if they would like to change. Cloud outages can
   happen to any provider, as the events of the last years have largely
   demonstrated, and have a critical impact on the actual reliability of
   cloud applications. A solution to both problems could be to support
   application developers and operators in the adoption of a multi-cloud
   approach: applications are built to run and replicate on different
   clouds, and mechanisms for fast switching from a cloud installation to
   the other are offered. In the MODA Clouds project we pursue this
   approach and rely on model-driven development combined with risk
   analysis and quality prediction. In this paper we provide an overview of
   our approach and present the architecture of the corresponding platform.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, Cloud Computing has rapidly become a widely
   accepted paradigm with core concepts such as elasticity, scalability and
   on-demand automatic resource provisioning emerging as next generation
   Cloud service -must have- properties. Automatic resource provisioning
   for Cloud applications is not a trivial task, requiring for both the
   applications and platform, to be constantly monitored, capturing
   information at various levels and time granularity. In this paper we
   describe the challenges that occur when monitoring elastically adaptive
   Cloud applications and to address these issues we present JCatascopia; a
   fully automated, multi-layer, interoperable Cloud Monitoring System.
   Experiments on different production Cloud platforms show that
   JCatascopia is a Monitoring System capable of supporting a fully
   automated Cloud resource provisioning system with proven
   interoperability, scalability and low runtime footprint. Most
   importantly, JCatascopia is able to adapt in a fully automatic manner
   when elasticity actions are enforced to an application deployment.}},

Abstract = {{One of the key benefits of Cloud systems is their ability to provide
   elastic, on-demand (seemingly infinite) computing capability and
   performance for supporting service delivery. With the resource
   availability in single data centres proving to be limited, the option of
   obtaining extra-resources from a collection of Cloud providers has
   appeared as an efficacious solution. The ability to utilize resources
   from multiple Cloud providers is also often mentioned as a means to: (i)
   prevent vendor lock in, (ii) to enable in house capacity to be combined
   with an external Cloud provider; (iii) combine specialist capability
   from multiple Cloud vendors (especially when one vendor does not offer
   such capability or where such capability may come at a higher price).
   Such federation of Cloud systems can therefore overcome a limit in
   capacity and enable providers to dynamically increase the availability
   of resources to serve requests. We describe and evaluate the
   establishment of such a federation using a CometCloud based
   implementation, and consider a number of federation policies with
   associated scenarios and determine the impact of such policies on the
   overall status of our system. CometCloud provides an overlay that
   enables multiple types of Cloud systems (both public and private) to be
   federated through the use of specialist gateways. We describe how two
   physical sites, in the UK and the US, can be federated in a seamless way
   using this system.}},

Abstract = {{Virtualization is the foundation of modern, cloud-based applications.
   The existence of virtual machines (VM) that host the components of such

Abstract = {{This work is integrated in the SmartCITIES Cloud Ticketing project from
   Link Consulting SA, aiming at proposing a multi- tenancy implementation
   of a ticketing system on the Amazon cloud platform. The SmartCITIES
   project introduced the ``thin device{''} concept, which allows
   transferring the traditional ticketing operations to a cloud platform,
   increasing elasticity and providing interoperability. This approach
   raises several concerns, namely security issues and latency in
   communications. A gate in a public transportation device has to check
   ticket validity in less than 300ms. With this in mind, we propose a
   Cloud Ticketing Communication Testing Platform (SmartSales), developed
   to benchmark the normal ticketing operations (e.g., sale, recharge and
   validation), while providing insights on the latency, according to
   several levels of security, available network and Cloud topology.
   Several metrics associated with the round-trip time (RTT) of
   communications made by the prototype were collected to explore possible
   situations where the ``thin device{''} concept can be used. The acquired
   results point towards the possible migration of most e-ticketing systems
   with the SmartCITIES Cloud Ticketing project architecture to the Cloud.

Abstract = {{Content Distribution Networks are mandatory components of modern web
   architectures, with plenty of vendors offering their services. Despite
   its maturity, new paradigms and architecture models are still being
   developed in this area. Cloud Computing, on the other hand, is a more
   recent concept which has expanded extremely quickly, with new services
   being regularly added to cloud management software suites such as
   OpenStack. The main contribution of this paper is the architecture and
   the development of an open source CDN that can be provisioned in an
   on-demand, pay-as-you-go model thereby enabling the CDN as a Service
   paradigm. We describe our experience with integration of CDNaaS
   framework in a cloud environment, as a service for enterprise users. We
   emphasize the flexibility and elasticity of such a model, with each CDN
   instance being delivered on-demand and associated to personalized
   caching policies as well as an optimized choice of Points of Presence
   based on exact requirements of an enterprise customer. Our development
   is based on the framework developed in the Mobile Cloud Networking (MCN)
   EU FP7 project, which offers its enterprise users a common framework to
   instantiate and control services. CDNaaS is one of the core support
   components in this project as is tasked to deliver different type of
   multimedia content to several thousands of users geographically
   distributed. It integrates seamlessly in the MCN service life-cycle and
   as such enjoys all benefits of a common design environment, allowing for
   an improved interoperability with the rest of the services within the
   MCN ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Among the various industry sectors, the financial industry in South
   Africa (SA) has been one of the early adopters of cloud computing (CC)
   but they have not fully implemented it because of barriers such as
   security and privacy, governance issues, inadequate cloud service level
   agreements (SLAs), vendor lock in, poor vendor transparency, inability
   to assess risks, confidentiality, integrity and availability. Few
   guidelines exist to help organizations improve their CC readiness level.
   This is particularly risky for financial institutions that deal with
   sensitive customer information as the safety of that information is not
   guaranteed if a desired readiness level is not attained before
   implementation. In order to assist financial institutions with this
   hurdle, this paper proposes a framework that will serve as a tool by
   which financial institutions can determine and improve their CC
   readiness. The framework is called ``Becoming Cloud Computing Ready{''}
   (BCCR) and it would help financial institutions to determine which stage
   they are with their CC readiness. It will also provide guidelines that
   will assist financial institutions to improve their level of readiness
   in order to ensure successful CC adoption. The proposed framework is
   grounded in both the literature as well as empirical data obtained from
   interviews with the largest financial institutions in SA.}},

Abstract = {{The SaaS model is software delivery model that allow the end user to use
   the software online without it being installed on their computer. The
   end user is charged by the service provider for using the services. Most
   of the existing Cloud cost models determine usage-charges based on
   infrastructure cost. In this paper, the cost model for the SaaS services
   is proposed that focuses not only on infrastructure but also on service
   parameters. The proposed model considers the service parameter for the
   SaaS such as customization, configurability, portability, security, QoS
   parameters including performance, usability, response timeliness,
   scalability and reliability, interoperability, data isolation and
   application isolation. With the help of proposed model, the service
   provider is able to calculate the efforts in developing the service more
   accurately and provide better service package deals to the service
   consumer.}},

   including: platform interoperability, access controls, scalable
   infrastructure and privacy and rights management. The Cloud presents a
   range of solutions to the problems posed by managing large data sets
   such as digital image collections; however, at this early stage the
   benefits and risks associated with cloud-based services are still being

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing has been one of the most vibrant topics in the last
   years. Especially Platform as a Service (PaaS) is said to be a game
   changer for future application development. Taking away most of the
   configuration work, it pledges to foster rapid application development
   which seems even more important in a world of complex scalable
   distributed systems. Whereas Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is in
   the process of consolidation and standardization, the PaaS market is
   largely fragmented offering varying ecosystem capabilities. In this
   situation, application portability is a major concern for companies
   utilizing PaaS to avoid vendor lock-in and to retain the ability for
   future strategical decisions. To categorize portability problems of
   PaaS, we define a model of current PaaS offerings and identify different
   portability perspectives. Starting from the model, we derive a
   standardized profile with a common set of capabilities that can be found
   among PaaS providers and matched with one another to check application
   portability based on ecosystem capabilities. We validate our findings
   with a comprehensive data set of 68 PaaS offerings together with a
   web-based application for portability matching. We also identify further
   portability problems by porting the application to different PaaS
   vendors, validating ecosystem portability and giving hints for future
   research directions.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile-based applications have become ubiquitous in many aspects of
   people's lives over the past few years. Harnessing the potential of this
   trend for healthcare purposes has become a focal point for researchers
   and industry, in particular designing applications that can be used by
   patients as part of their wellness, prevention, or treatment process.
   Along the way, mobile cloud computing (MCC) has been introduced to be a
   potential paradigm for mobile health services to overcome the
   interoperability issues across different information formats. In this
   paper, we propose a mobile cloud-based food calorie measurement system.
   Our system provides users with convenient and intelligent mechanisms
   that allow them to track their food intake and monitor their calorie
   count. The food recognition technique in our system uses cloud Support
   Vector Machine (SVM) training mechanism in a cloud computing environment
   with Map Reduce technique for distributed machine learning. The details
   of the system and its implementation results are recorded in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In latest years, the concept of interconnecting clouds to allow common
   service coordination has gained significant attention mainly because of
   the increasing utilization of cloud resources from Internet users. An
   efficient common management between different clouds is essential
   benefit, like boundless elasticity and scalability. Yet, issues related
   with different standards led to interoperability problems. For this
   reason, the definition of the open cloud-computing interface defines a
   set of open community-lead specifications along with a flexible API to
   build cloud systems. Today, there are cloud systems like OpenStack,
   OpenNebula, Amazon Web Services and VMWare VCloud that expose APIs for
   inter-cloud communication. In this work we aim to explore an inter-cloud
   model by creating a new cloud platform service to act as a mediator
   among OpenStack, FI-WARE datacenter resource management and Amazon Web
   Service cloud architectures, therefore to orchestrate communication of
   various cloud environments. The model is based on the FI-WARE and will
   be offered as a reusable enabler with an open specification to allow
   interoperable service coordination.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and reports the development of an open source
   solution for the integrated management of Infrastructure as a Service
   (IaaS) cloud computing resources, through the use of a common API
   taxonomy, to incorporate open source and proprietary platforms. This
   research included two surveys on open source IaaS platforms (OpenNebula,
   OpenStack and CloudStack) and a proprietary platform (Parallels
   Automation for Cloud Infrastructure - PACI) as well as on IaaS
   abstraction solutions (jClouds, Libcloud and Deltacloud), followed by a
   thorough comparison to determine the best approach. The adopted
   implementation reuses the Apache Deltacloud open source abstraction
   framework, which relies on the development of software driver modules to
   interface with different IaaS platforms, and involved the development of
   a new Deltacloud driver for PACI. The resulting interoperable solution
   successfully incorporates OpenNebula, OpenStack (reuses pre-existing
   drivers) and PACI (includes the developed Deltacloud PACI driver) nodes
   and provides a Web dashboard and a Representational State Transfer
   (REST) interface library. The results of the exchanged data payload and
   time response tests performed are presented and discussed. The
   conclusions show that open source abstraction tools like Deltacloud
   allow the modular and integrated management of IaaS platforms (open
   source and proprietary), introduce relevant time and negligible data
   overheads and, as a result, can be adopted by Small and Medium-sized
   Enterprise (SME) cloud providers to circumvent the vendor lock-in
   problem whenever service response time is not critical.}},

Abstract = {{The paradigm of Software as a Service (SaaS) offers an interesting
   option to vendors of simulation software for providing their
   applications to a wide circle of customers. However, this imposes a
   challenge to vendors whose applications exist only as classical desktop
   tools, so far: Interfaces for the remote control have to be provided
   which are as independent from the underlying cloud infrastructure as
   possible in order to avoid vendor lock-ins. We present an interoperable
   platform developed in the project Cloud4E (Trusted Cloud Computing for
   Engineering), which allows the provisioning of existing simulation
   software in form of a service in a cloud. The interoperability of the
   platform and of the services is achieved by the usage of the Open Cloud
   Computing Interface (OCCI) together with the Advanced Message Queuing
   Protocol (AMQP) where OCCI is not only used as interface to
   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) but also as interface to SaaS. Hence,
   the OCCI server plays a central role within the platform and can quickly
   become a bottleneck, which degrades the performance of the whole
   platform. We present detailed performance investigations and suggest
   options to improve the performance. The investigations were performed on
   the widely used OCCI server implementation called rOCCI server connected
   to the OpenNebula cloud middleware.}},

Abstract = {{Parallel scientific workloads typically entail highly-customised
   software environments, involving complex data structures, specialised
   systems software, and even distinct hardware, where virtualisation is
   not necessarily supported by third-party providers. Considering the
   expansion of cloud computing in different domains and the development of
   different proprietary (e.g. Amazon Web Services, Azure) and open source
   cloud platforms (Eucalyptus, OpenStack, OpenNebula), users should
   arguably be able to automatically and seamlessly migrate their parallel
   workloads across cloud platforms using standardised virtual machines.
   However, even if it is easier to migrate the workload between nodes when
   the nodes have a similar configuration on the same platform, the
   transition between different platforms typically raises different issues
   such as vendor lock-in, portability, and interoperability.
   In this paper, we describe our work to automatically deploy a complex
   parallel software stack on heterogeneous hybrid cloud platforms. We have
   elastically deployed FastFlow-a C/C++ pattern-based programming
   framework for multi-/many-core and distributed platforms-using virtual
   machines on both CPU and GPU-based architectures between heterogeneous
   virtualised platforms. Our approach relies on the standard Open
   Virtualization Format (OVF) in order to achieve a universal description
   of virtual appliances. Such a description is not only useful for
   elastically migrating and deploying, but also to determine the
   hardware/system software configuration needed switching to any new
   (cloud) image format. We have successfully evaluated our work using
   virtual machines based on VirtualBox and Amazon Web Services on local
   cluster and public cloud providers.}},

Abstract = {{With Cloud Computing there comes new possibilities like programmability
   of Infrastructure via provider exposed APIs. These APIs can aid the
   concept of elasticity that is associated with the Cloud however, there
   is a trend that these APIs are provider specific in the abstract of
   functionality and interface. There are yet no governing standards for
   the provision of Cloud APIs. One method to overcome this lack of
   standards is Open APIs like jClouds and Cloudify. This paper reviews
   literature and proposes eight criteria and fifty-five sub-criteria that
   can be used to evaluate jClouds and Cloudify. The evaluation will be
   performed on the creation of a web service based cloud console prototype
   with these APIs as demonstration of the most common type of Cloud
   Application, a Web application. This paper will propose that the use of
   Open APIs enhances or enables forty-eight of the sub-criteria and
   potentially diminishes one sub-criteria which is security related. This
   paper also proposes that lack of inclusion of billing APIs in Cloud
   Provider API offering is an area of omission.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a convenient, on demand, model which relies on shared
   pool of computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and needs
   minimal management effort. As cloud computing obtains popularity
   nowadays, customers are looking for cloud solutions to adapt their
   organization's requirements. The more changes occur, customers are
   trying to decide what kind of cloud they are going to choose. Beside
   that, users are concerned about security, privacy, vendor lock-in and
   cost issues. A hybrid cloud is a mix of one private cloud and at least
   one public cloud, customers could benefit interoperability and
   flexibility. There are many elements that should be considered in hybrid
   cloud architecture. This paper represents a set of mpi benchmarking test
   executed on a private and public cloud environment in order to evaluate
   the QoS when real application is running.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of virtualization technologies and cloud computing has
   improved application provisioning speed, resource utilization,
   fault-management, availability using auto-failover and performance
   optimization using auto-scaling in distributed computing environments.
   However, heterogeneous virtualization technologies offered by different
   service providers with disparate infrastructure and their orchestration
   and management systems have also increased the complexity of managing
   distributed applications and vendor lock-in. In this paper we utilize
   new computing, management and programming models introduced using the
   DIME network architecture to provide end to end service visibility and
   control across distributed physical or virtual infrastructure. Resulting
   decoupling of application and service transaction management from myriad
   distributed infrastructure management systems at run-time enables policy
   based, secure, service mobility across physical servers or virtual
   machines deployed in datacenters or public clouds. Using the new
   architecture we have implemented service self-repair, auto-scaling,
   live-migration and end-to-end service transaction security independent
   of server and network security mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, data-intensive scientific research needs storage capabilities
   that enable efficient data sharing. This is of great importance for many
   scientific domains such as the Virtual Physiological Human. In this
   paper, we introduce a solution that federates a variety of systems
   ranging from file servers to more sophisticated ones used in clouds or
   grids. Our solution follows a client-centric approach that loosely
   couples a variety of data resources that may use different technologies
   such as Openstack-Swift, iRODS, GridFTP, and may be geographically
   distributed. It is implemented as a lightweight service which does not
   require installation of a software on the resources it uses. In this way
   we are able to efficiently use heterogeneous storage resources, reduce
   the usage complexity of multiple storage resources, and avoid vendor
   lock-in in case of cloud storage. To demonstrate the usability of our
   approach we performed a number of experiments that assess the
   performance and functionality of the developed system.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, we have seen the rapid emergence of a plethora of Cloud
   providers with individual infrastructures, APIs and application
   description formats. This heterogeneity has resulted in vendor lock-in,
   which reduces consumer flexibility in terms of negotiation power,
   reaction to price increases and freedom to change provider. Achieving
   interoperability between Clouds is a means of addressing this issue. To
   realise this, the use of open standards has been suggested, but the
   existing standards are focused mainly on portability instead of
   interoperability. Besides, this heterogenous nature of Clouds makes
   inter-Cloud monitoring to facilitate interoperable Cloud management
   difficult. In this paper, we present a novel integrated approach to
   achieve interoperability between Clouds and to facilitate the management
   of service provisioning using multiple Clouds. The approach is based on
   the integration of a holistic message bus system with monitoring
   techniques. We present the design and implementation descriptions, and
   based on a use case scenario, we demonstrate a practical realisation of
   our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Recently cloud services have been evaluated by scientific communities as
   a viable solution to satisfy their computing needs, reducing the cost of
   ownership and operation to the minimum. The analysis on the adoption of
   the cloud computing model for eScience has identified several areas of
   improvement as federation management and interoperability between
   providers. Portability between cloud vendors is a widely recognized
   feature to avoid the risk of lock-in of users in proprietary systems, a
   stopper to the complete adoption of clouds.
   In this paper we present a programming framework that allows the
   coordination of applications on federated clouds used to provide
   flexibility to traditional research infrastructures as clusters and
   grids. This approach allows researchers to program applications
   abstracting the underlying infrastructure and providing scaling and
   elasticity features through the dynamic provision of virtualized
   resources. The adoption of standard interfaces is a basic feature in the
   development of connectors for different middlewares ensuring the
   portability of the code between different providers.}},

Abstract = {{E-learning can be referred to as ``education through electronic
   media{''}. It is one of the most emerging concepts in the field of
   technology. E-learning systems can be either synchronous or
   asynchronous. Agent based e-learning is helpful in managing the
   information overload, it can serve as academic expert and manages
   creation of programming environment for learners. There are many
   characteristics that an E-learning environment has to support; they are
   Interaction, Data Security, User Personalization, Adaptability,
   Intelligence, Interoperability, Accessibility and User Authentication.
   E-learning must also support a few other features like cost
   effectiveness, reusability, storage capacity, powerful computing and
   virtualization which can be provided by Cloud computing. Cloud computing
   is everywhere these days, pick any blogs, journals, papers. The Cloud
   computing Architecture is built using three models, Software as a
   Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a
   Service (IaaS), which provides a variety of services. This proposed
   architecture integrates the features of Agents and Cloud Computing to
   produce an Agent based Cloud Computing Architecture to enhance
   e-learning.}},

Abstract = {{The cloud computing paradigm promises increased flexibility and
   scalability for consumers and providers of software services. Service
   providers that exploit private cloud environments offer restricted
   flexibility and scalability because of the limited capacity. However,
   such organizations are often reluctant to migrate to public clouds
   because of business continuity threats and vendor lock-in. Hybrid clouds
   potentially combine the benefits of private and public (external)
   clouds. Vendor lock-in can be avoided when multiple external clouds are
   supported and effectively exploited.
   This paper presents a middleware platform for hybrid cloud applications.
   The middleware enables organizations to control the execution of their
   applications in hybrid cloud environments. Driven by policies, the
   middleware can dynamically decide which requests and tasks are executed
   on a particular part of the hybrid cloud. The core of the middleware,
   and the focus of this paper, is an abstraction layer. The abstraction
   layer enables portability over multiple services including data storage,
   blob storage, and asynchronous task execution of various PaaS platforms
   as well as interoperability between the PaaS platforms. We have
   validated the core concept by building a prototype implementation that
   runs on top of specific PaaS platforms as well as on a cloud-enabling
   middleware. A document processing SaaS application has been instantiated
   on the middleware. Performance results have been collected for JBoss AS
   cluster, Google App Engine, and Red Hat OpenShift.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing (the delivery of computing as services rather than
   products) creates new challenges with respect to openness. Existing
   approaches such as open source licensing of software products have
   proven inadequate in a service-oriented world; attempts to address the
   limitations by closing the ``service provider loophole{''} have failed
   to gain traction. Similarly, multiple providers are yet to fully adopt a
   single, complete cloud infrastructure management interface.
   In this paper a simple ``lowest common denominator{''} approach to cloud
   portability is proposed, modeled after the success of Internet email and
   the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and based on the ubiquitous
   HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The proposed approach is suitable
   for all workloads and supports any format specified elsewhere and
   identified by Internet media (MIME) type (e. g. virtual machines,
   databases, queues).
   By addressing only the functionality absolutely required for
   portability, leaving the management interface out of scope, we can
   deliver an API which is compatible with all cloud stacks while avoiding
   constraining their functionality.}},

Journal = {{IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{271-276}},
Abstract = {{The demand for cloud computing has greatly increased in the past few
   years due to the offering of computing as a service form. The
   vendor-dependent implementation of cloud service providers, cloud
   interoperability, is an immense concern for cloud users as well as
   service providers. Another issue is the difficulty of selecting an
   appropriate provider considering the specific user requirements and a
   diverse vendor centric approach. Besides the standardization process,
   one of the most significant current discussions in cloud computing is
   the cloud-brokering service. Cloud brokering is having a positive impact
   in choosing an appropriate provider along with the capability to handle
   cloud-to-cloud communication. From the recent proposals, we re-evaluate
   the brokering and load-balancing algorithms with a generated workload.
   This study produced results that corroborate the findings of a great
   deal of the previous work in this field. The current findings of recent
   works add to a growing body of literature on cloud-brokering and
   load-balancing algorithms. In this paper, we revisited existing
   cloud-brokering algorithms in order to propose a new cloud-brokering
   architecture with the enhancement of brokering algorithms to improve
   brokering performance. Another contribution is to identify the best
   combination of all the proposed algorithms based on the processing time
   and response time.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring and management are multidisciplinary tasks
   which require a continuous and close cooperation among involved
   stakeholders from various public entities, based in different locations.
   This fact poses a serious problem on critical aspects of

   management, sharing and interoperability. This problem can be tackled
   using cloud computing technology and services which can provide to
   stakeholders capabilities regarding the above issues in real time, thus
   providing the means for an effective environmental management and

   relationship by identifying the special features and needs associated
   with environmental projects which in turn may be satisfied and optimised
   through geospatial cloud computing components termed in the present as
   GeoClouds. GeoClouds are proven geospatial tools and services and

Abstract = {{The unabated flurry of research activities to augment various mobile
   devices by leveraging heterogeneous cloud resources has created a new
   research domain called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). In the core of such
   a non-uniform environment, facilitating interoperability, portability,
   and integration among heterogeneous platforms is nontrivial. Building
   such facilitators in MCC requires investigations to understand
   heterogeneity and its challenges over the roots. Although there are many
   research studies in mobile computing and cloud computing, convergence of
   these two areas grants further academic efforts towards flourishing MCC.
   In this paper, we define MCC, explain its major challenges, discuss
   heterogeneity in convergent computing (i.e. mobile computing and cloud
   computing) and networking (wired and wireless networks), and divide it
   into two dimensions, namely vertical and horizontal. Heterogeneity roots
   are analyzed and taxonomized as hardware, platform, feature, API, and
   network. Multidimensional heterogeneity in MCC results in application
   and code fragmentation problems that impede development of
   cross-platform mobile applications which is mathematically described.
   The impacts of heterogeneity in MCC are investigated, related
   opportunities and challenges are identified, and predominant
   heterogeneity handling approaches like virtualization, middleware, and
   service oriented architecture (SOA) are discussed. We outline open
   issues that help in identifying new research directions in MCC.}},

Abstract = {{This research is motivated by several open research questions about
   cloud solutions, such as how to wisely choose a cloud host for services
   and how to change the cloud provider in an easy manner. The ability to
   move the services from one to another provider in a simpler manner is
   the definition of the cloud service portability, as an open research
   area which deserves more attention. In this paper we propose a new cloud
   portability service platform and we give an overview of the current
   trends in the area of cloud service portability, especially analyzing
   the TOSCA's approach. Our new platform proposal is based on establishing
   an adapter model, which offers the desired cloud portability. The new
   solution describes the services by a XML TOSCA approach aiming to build
   a custom Platform as a Service (PaaS) that can accept and exchange
   installations of any portable application. The scenario for the new
   approach assumes that the applications are described by appropriate
   installation requirements and application structure using the TOSCA
   specificationandthe platform performs the necessary installation
   according to the specificationto continue with automatic deployment of
   application/services. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The need for high reliability, availability and performance has
   significantly increased in modern applications, that handle rapidly
   growing demands while providing uninterruptible services. Cloud
   computing systems fundamentally provide access to large pools of data
   and computational resources. Eucalyptus is a software framework largely
   used to implement private clouds and hybrid-style Infrastructure as a
   Service. It implements the Amazon Web Service (AWS) API, allowing
   interoperability with other AWS-based services. This article
   investigates the software aging effects in the Eucalyptus framework,
   considering workloads composed of intensive requests for remote storage
   attachment and virtual machine instantiations. We found problems that
   may be harmful to system dependability and performance, specifically
   regarding to RAM memory and swap space exhaustion, besides highly
   excessive CPU utilization by the virtual machines. We also present an
   approach that applies time series analysis to schedule rejuvenation, so
   as to reduce the downtime by predicting the proper moment to perform the
   rejuvenation. We experimentally evaluate our approach using an
   Eucalyptus test bed. The results show that our approach achieves higher
   availability, when compared to a threshold-triggered rejuvenation method
   based on continuous monitoring of resources utilization.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional cloud computing providers enable developers to program and
   deploy applications in the cloud by using platform as a service (PaaS)
   providers. Despite the benefits of such an approach, this service model
   usually comes with a high level of the lock in effect into the service
   provider. The lock in effect occurs when a software developer needs to
   change its cloud provider. When this happens, it usually means a major
   application rewrite, specific for the new PaaS. This paper details the
   initial results of a project whose goal is to build a PaaS where vendor
   lock in does not occur. With this PaaS, developers wishing to deploy
   their applications into the cloud may continue to program using their
   usual development environments. There are no necessary changes required
   to make the application PaaS compatible. As a proof of concept, we
   developed an open source PaaS management application as a regular web
   application and then deployed it on the cloud.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main advantages of the cloud computing paradigm is that it
   simplifies the time-consuming processes of hardware provisioning,
   hardware procurement and software deployment. Currently, we are
   witnessing a proliferation in the number of cloud-hosted applications.
   However, one of the important challenges of the cloud computing paradigm
   that may hurt the growth of this technology is the interoperability and
   portability between cloud platforms. The developers and cloud users may
   lock-in to the first cloud they choose, or face difficulties when they
   have to move their data or software from one cloud platform to another.
   In this paper, we focus on the challenge of data portability between
   different cloud-based data storage services. In particular, we propose a
   common data model and a standardized API for the new generation of
   cloud-based NoSQL databases. The initial implementation of our framework
   covers three of the most popular NoSQL systems, namely, Google
   Datastore, Amazon SimpleDB and MongoDB. However, our framework is
   designed in a flexible way that it can be easily extended to support
   other NoSQL systems. Furthermore, our framework is equipped with tools
   that support the conversion, transformation and exchange of the data
   which is stored on the supported NoSQL databases of the framework.
   Finally, we describe the design and the proof-of-concept implementation
   of our framework using a case study.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an emerging IT paradigm proving cost reduction and
   flexibility benefits. However security and privacy are serious issues
   challenging its adoption and sustainability in both social and
   commercial areas. Public clouds, in particular, present a controversial
   which is brought up by the need to exchange critical and protected data
   (even sensitive) between heterogeneous domains that are governed by
   multiple legislation. Access control is one of the essential and
   traditional security arms of data protection. However, in the context of
   open and dynamic environments such as clouds, access control becomes
   more complicated. This is because the security policies, models and
   related mechanisms have to be defined across various security domains
   and enforced in an integrated manner as required. Thus, improving the
   current access control paradigms is crucial in order to ensure privacy
   compliance in open and heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we
   propose a framework that is driven by legislation and which aims to
   assure an access control that preserves privacy while dealing with
   personal data hosted in public clouds. In addition, the proposed
   framework deals with the problem of interoperability between
   heterogeneous policies governing the processing of personal data on a
   cloud environment. In this regards, the need for access control
   delegation is also presented and tackled.}},

Abstract = {{The pervasiveness of connected embedded devices and Internet of Things
   (IoT) related application domains like smart cities, e-Health or,
   transportation lead to an constantly increasing amount of data,
   compute-and storage resources surrounding us. However, currently there
   is a gap between data acquisition and processing, usually bridged by
   gateway based approaches that integrate the devices and forward the data
   to Clouds in order to be processed. Integration is often static and
   limited to a certain application domain, which the gateway is able to
   support. In addition, processing does not consider the compute-and
   storage resources already made available by the growing amount of smart
   devices, like smart TVs or smart phones. As a solution, we propose the
   Device Cloud, which can be envisioned as an application of the Cloud
   Computing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service
   (PaaS) paradigms to the IoT domain. The approach will allow sharing and
   on demand provisioning of resources provided by the connected embedded
   devices surrounding us. Besides introducing an architecture draft to
   provide a common understanding of the overall problem, the main focus of
   the paper is to discuss challenges that arise and give a state of the
   art review of related research initiatives that are eligible to
   contribute to possible solutions.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing user demand for elastic provisioning of resources
   coupled with ubiquitous and on-demand access to data, cloud computing
   has been recognized as an emerging technology to meet such dynamic user
   demands. In addition, with the introduction and rising use of mobile
   devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received considerable
   attention since the IoT has brought physical devices and connected them
   to the Internet, enabling each device to share data with surrounding
   devices and virtualized technologies in real-time. Consequently, the
   exploding data usage requires a new, innovative computing platform that
   can provide robust real-time data analytics and resource provisioning to
   clients. As a result, fog computing has recently been introduced to
   provide computation, storage and networking services between the
   end-users and traditional cloud computing data centers. This paper
   proposes a policy-based management of resources in fog computing,
   expanding the current fog computing platform to support secure

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing has emerged as a new paradigm in the field of
   network-based services within many industrial and application domains.
   The major benefits that it provides in terms of IT efficiency and
   business agility represent a huge competitive advantage for an
   organization. However, building new services in the cloud or designing
   cloud-based solutions into existing business context in general is a
   complex decision process involving many factors. In this paper, we
   undertake a systematic review to obtain an overview of the existing
   studies in designing cloud-based solutions. In particular, we
   investigate the main challenges and concerns when building cloud-based
   architectures and different architectural approaches and design
   considerations that are proposed in literatures to meet these specific
   concerns. The search strategy identified 72 studies that were catalogued
   as primary studies for this review after using multi-step selection
   process. The main challenges and concerns are classified into four main
   categories: security and trustworthiness, elasticity, portability and
   interoperability, and cloud resilience. We have also categorized studies
   that describe architectural approaches and design considerations when
   architecting for the cloud. Implications for research and practice are
   presented as well.}},

Abstract = {{The Open Virtualization Format (OVF) is a software packaging standard
   designed to support the portability and deployment of applications in
   different virtualization platforms. Ease interoperability and
   portability among cloud providers is of paramount importance to mitigate
   vendor lock-in and fostering cooperation among different cloud
   technologies. To this end, the researcher community is spending a lot of
   effort in investigating cloud broker and cloud federation solutions.
   However, we feel that the community still misses an open-source
   reference tool for the management of these operations when it comes to
   the OVF standard. With the aim to fill this gap, we propose the OVF
   Toolkit, an open tool to parse, render, and split OVF files. This paper
   describes the principal design decisions, the implementation, and the
   capabilities of the toolkit, as well as its experimental evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing distribution and integration of mobile devices into
   today's information systems, there is a growing demand for
   interoperability between heterogeneous computation systems. Cloud
   systems already serve as an integration point between heterogeneous
   devices using classic client/server concepts such as web services.
   However, this technology significantly limits possible applications. In
   this paper we consider virtual machines as a possible solution for
   extending the applicability for integration of mobile devices into cloud
   systems. We investigate the concept of migrating VM instances between
   clouds and local devices also considering heterogeneous computing
   architectures like ARM and x86. We are using an off-line approach, where
   a VM is transferred without being responsive. A stop, move and resume
   process is already sufficient for certain use cases and could increase
   interoperability and reduce vendor lock-in effects. We present an
   approach for off-line VM migration between OpenStack and local devices
   and evaluate our proof of concept implementation. Our results for
   migration costs and performance show several challenges and the need for
   further optimization. However, even the unoptimized migration costs
   might already be acceptable in certain scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{As distributed, on-line communities are increasingly supported by the
   global, interconnected computing infrastructure, methods must be
   developed to securely manage their interactions. The virtual
   organization (VO) concept provides a security and discovery context
   whereby collaboration across multiple administrative domains can be
   enabled while enforcing joint security policies. In the era of cloud
   computing, VOs can be used to manage ``community clouds{''}, i.e., cloud
   federations. In this paper, we describe a method for re-purposing the
   OpenStack Keystone service to act as a VO Management System (VOMS)
   called KeyVOMS. With minor changes, it can be used to manage access to
   services that are registered for use by members of any given VO. These
   services can be arbitrary infrastructure-level or application-level
   services. This is illustrated by using KeyVOMS to manage access to a set
   of RSS feed topics. While very flexible, the use of an external,
   third-party, such as KeyVOMS, raises fundamental semantic
   interoperability and trust delegation issues that must be addressed in
   future work.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is emerging as a viable platform for scientific
   exploration. The ideas of on demand access to resources, ``unlimited{''}
   resources as well as interesting pricing models are making scientist to
   move their workflows into cloud computing. However, the amount of
   services and different pricing models offered by the providers often
   overwhelm users when deciding which option is best for them. Moreover,
   interoperability across providers remains an open topic that forces
   users to develop specific solutions for each provider. In this paper, we
   present a service framework that enables the autonomic execution of
   dynamic workflows in multi cloud environments. It also allows users to
   customize scheduling policies to use those resources that best fit their
   needs. To demonstrate the benefits of this framework, we study the
   execution of a real scientific workflow, with data dependencies across

Abstract = {{The broad diffusion of Cloud Computing has fostered the proliferation of
   a large number of cloud computing providers. The need of Cloud Brokers
   arises for helping consumers in discovering, considering and comparing
   services with different capabilities and offered by different providers.
   Also, consuming services exposed by different providers, when possible,
   may alleviate the vendor lock-in. While it can be straightforward to
   choose the best provider when deploying small and homogeneous
   applications, things get harder if the size and complexity of
   applications grow up. In this paper we propose a genetic approach for
   Cloud Brokering, focusing on finding Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
   resources for satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of
   applications. We performed a set of experiments with an implementation
   of such broker. Results show that our broker can find near-optimal
   solutions even when dealing with hundreds of providers, trying at the
   same time to mitigate the vendor lock-in.}},

Abstract = {{The market of cloud computing encompasses an ever-growing number of
   cloud providers offering a multitude of infrastructure-as-a-service
   (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions. The heterogeneity of
   these solutions hinders the proper exploitation of cloud computing since
   it prevents interoperability and promotes vendor lock-in, which
   increases the complexity of executing and managing multi-cloud
   applications (i.e., applications that can be deployed across multiple
   cloud infrastructures and platforms). Providers of multi-cloud
   applications seek to exploit the peculiarities of each cloud solution
   and to combine the delivery models of IaaS and PaaS in order to optimise
   performance, availability, and cost. In this paper, we show how the
   Cloud Modelling Framework leverages upon model-driven engineering to
   tame this complexity by providing: (i) a tool-supported domain-specific
   language for specifying the provisioning and deployment of multi-cloud
   applications, and (ii) a models@ run-time environment for enacting the
   provisioning, deployment, and adaptation of these applications.}},

Abstract = {{In academia, many institutes have deployed IaaS cloud services in
   isolation, based on cloud management frameworks of their choice, making
   the cloudscape quite heterogeneous. Now, with the effort to federate
   cloud resources well underway, the challenge is not to make everyone
   switch to a common solution, but rather to allow everyone to keep their
   setup but still provide uniform access to essential services. This seems
   to be best achieved by implementing common standards. This paper
   discusses the different areas such standardization effort must address,
   ranging from the choice of the actual standardization approach (i.e.,
   choosing a recognized open standard or possibly a non-standard solution
   with a strong community backing) through authentication and virtual
   machine life-cycle management to monitoring or accounting (billing)
   services. The discussion is based on the authors' own practical
   experience with implementing standard compliance in multiple cloud
   management frameworks, producing a real-world interoperability
   solution-the rOCCI Framework-which is also introduced in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial organizations use Energy Management Systems (EMS) to monitor,
   control, and optimize their energy consumption. Industrial EMS are
   complex and expensive systems due to the unique requirements of
   performance, reliability, and interoperability. Moreover, industry is
   facing challenges with current EMS implementations such as cross-site
   monitoring of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, integration between
   energy and production data, and meaningful energy efficiency
   benchmarking. Additionally, big data has emerged because of recent
   advances in field instrumentation that led to the generation of large
   quantities of machine data, with much more detail and higher sampling
   rates. This created a challenge for real-time analytics. In order to
   address all these needs and challenges, we propose a cloud-native
   industrial EMS solution with cloud computing capabilities. Through this
   innovative approach we expect to generate useful knowledge in a shorter
   time period, enabling organizations to react quicker to changes of

Abstract = {{Due to lack of information of the cloud service providers (CSPs),
   customers can not easily choose services according to their requirement
   and due to vendor lock-in and lack of interoperability standards among
   cloud service providers, customers cannot switch the providers once
   services are subscribed from CSPs. Recently proposed third party
   architecture which is called cloud broker can access inter-cloud and
   provides services to the customers according to their requirement but
   providing SLA based cloud services as per their requirement is still
   missing in current researches. In our work, we propose the SLA assured
   brokering framework which matches the requirements of the customer with
   SLA offered by CSPs using similarity matching algorithm and willingness
   to pay capacity for the services. It also measures the services offered
   by CSPs for certifying and ranking the CSPs.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing, as a new system and architecture of data mutual
   sharing, is composed of three service models i.e. cloud software as a
   service (SaaS), cloud platform as a service (PaaS) and cloud
   infrastructure as a service (IaaS), as well as including three key
   enabling technologies i.e. networks of fast wide-area, server computers
   of powerful and inexpensive specialty, and commodity hardware of
   high-performance virtualization. Cloud computing technology brings in
   innovative and constructive ideas for the medical and health
   informatization. However, it also challenges many traditional approaches
   to application design and management of medical-sanitary institutions or
   other datacenters, especially the relevant issues of security,
   interoperability, portability, et al. that cited as major barriers to
   broader adoption. Based on the concept, key technology, core problem and
   principles, the author attempts to discuss the main issues of cloud
   computing in the construction and development of the medical and health
   informatization. We hope these considerations can provide reference to
   the service for the present medical informatization construction and
   practical decision-making in the context of big data.}},

Abstract = {{Current PaaS solutions use an underlying IaaS provider and restrict
   themselves to a few geographical regions. They operate in one/two zones
   only and use others for failover or disaster recovery. In this paper, we
   present the design of MultiPaaS, a PaaS solution which runs on multiple
   cloud/IaaS providers and leverages the combined global span. Unlike
   traditional scaling techniques where app servers are scaled up or down
   in a specific region or data center, we present a design to perform it
   on a global scale. Origin of the request burst is identified and
   instances are booted in a data center closest to it. It ensures database
   persistence and cross-region scalability via a combination of
   replication techniques. We identify common features available across all
   IaaS providers and use that as a provider interface to ensure
   interoperability, but use provider specific extensions to leverage
   unique offerings and benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Among the many limitations that the clouds are facing today, the
   heterogeneity of IT resources and networks. The dynamic deployment and
   on-demand applications are also major challenges. To ensure this
   deployment, it is essential to rely on methods of managing applications
   and services in a cloud. This paper proposes to apply the concept of
   Virtual Appliance for cloud architectures to ensure the dynamic
   deployment, interoperability and reuse of services supported by these
   clouds. Proposed architecture aims to solve problems of users whose are
   blocked from sellers with very little flexibility to move their services
   to other providers. Using standards of DMTF could provide more
   flexibility and response to user's requirement under SLA constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is the blending technology of parallel and distributing
   computing, and its main aim is providing Everything as a Service to the
   consumers. The private cloud is one of the deployment models and it
   offers resources in an on-demand manner. Resource Management is the
   challenging task between different private cloud because of the
   interoperability issues since the private clouds are managed by
   different type of cloud middleware's and each of them has their own
   mechanism and protocols. To manage the resource efficiently and to
   increase the resource availability it is essential to overcome the
   interoperability issues between the private clouds. In this paper a
   common mechanism called Semantic Cloud Resource Broker (SCRB) is
   introduced between the Eucalyptus and Open Nebula based private clouds.
   It also includes the semantic technology to achieve meaningful search.
   Hence an OWL-based ontology indexing and retrieval algorithms is
   implemented to improve precision and recall and thereby improves the
   success rate of cloud resources.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is fast becoming one of the most essential
   research topics for distributed resource networks. Users can easily
   access cloud while offloading their mobile applications from anywhere
   anytime. Being easy to access, intruder attacks mobile networks to
   acquire credential from mobile applications inside and outside the cloud
   computing. To investigate intruder's attacks, digital investigator has
   to identify the root cause of the attack. However, investigating MCC
   infrastructure is difficult due to its characteristics of
   virtualization, dispersion of data, multi tenancy, interoperability, and
   mobility. In this paper, we present an overview of MCC and digital
   forensics, focusing on its key aspects and significant forensic
   challenges faced by digital investigators in MCC. The purpose of this
   paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding about forensic
   research challenges and re-direct researchers towards new research

Abstract = {{Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for organizations to
   adopt IT services at a reduced cost with increased reliability and
   scalability. However organizations are slow in adopting the cloud model
   due to the prevalent vendor lock-in issue and challenges associated with
   it. While the existing cloud solutions for public and private companies
   are vendor locked-in by design, their existence is subject to limited
   possibility to interoperate with other cloud systems. In this paper we
   have presented a critical review of pertinent business, technical and
   legal issues associated with vendor lock-in, and how it impacts on the
   widespread adoption of cloud computing. The paper attempts to reflect on
   the issues associated with interoperability and portability, but with a
   focus on vendor lock-in. Moreover, the paper demonstrates the importance
   of interoperability, portability and standards applicable to cloud
   computing environments along with highlighting other corporate concerns
   due to the lock-in problem. The outcome of this paper provides a
   foundation for future analysis and review regarding the impact of vendor
   neutrality for corporate cloud computing application and services.}},

Abstract = {{The distributed and complexity nature of modern critical infrastructures
   that have to provide integrated services through the interoperability of
   heterogeneous subsystems, even spread among different countries, require
   new methodologies and tools to dominate overall systems complexity. In
   particular, in order to get knowledge about their real behavior and
   define dependability improvement actions, such complex and distributed
   systems should be reproduced and simulated locally. On the other hand,
   the extraordinary large number of their components cause a large-scale
   of the resulting model, limiting its resolution by current simulators.
   This paper presents a framework to implement hybrid simulation of
   distributed large-scale critical infrastructures, such as Air Traffic
   Control (ATC) and Vessel Traffic System (VTS). High Level Architecture
   (HLA) has been introduced into the engine simulations platform as its
   design and development foundation, whereas cloud-based virtualization
   techniques have been exploited in order to reproduce the overall
   distributed system on a local adaptive testbed. The use of such a
   framework can result in a considerable reduction of costs in all the
   system life phases, as well as an increased system dependability level.}},

Abstract = {{Starting with the provision of ready-to-use infrastructures, such as
   storage and compute resources, cloud computing quickly became a
   flexible, cost-effective and complete environment for a wide range of IT
   services offered over the Internet. A growing number of cloud providers
   started to expose their own services to the market, to answer consumer's
   need, engaging a competition in the attempt to offer the easiest access
   to resources and the wider catalogue of services. Being integrated with
   proprietary services and infrastructures, these offerings makes
   difficult to switch between different underlying technologies, so that
   the customer is tied to the service provider's strategy. This lack in
   standards interfaces, service requirements and technologies brings into
   the cloud the vendor lock-in problem. Due to this complex scenery, a
   categorization of services to support the choice of the right solution,
   as well as a semantic and computable description of services that
   enables the comparison and the mapping between different providers'
   services, proves to be extremely appealing. In an attempt to take a
   first important step in this context we propose the semantic description
   of some cloud services, exposing them in terms of functionalities,
   parameters exchanged, and collaboration between services. In particular
   in this paper we present the semantic representation of Microsoft
   Windows Azure APIs, describing functional and non-functional properties
   of the services.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent advances in cloud computing and the improvement in the
   capabilities of mobile devices in terms of speed, storage, and computing
   power, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is emerging as one of important
   branches of cloud computing. MCC is an extension of cloud computing with
   the support of mobility. In this paper, we first present the specific
   concerns and key challenges in mobile cloud computing, we then discuss
   the different approaches to tackle the main issues in MCC that have been
   introduced so far, and finally we focus on describing the proposed
   overall architecture of a middleware that will contribute to providing
   mobile users data storage and processing services based on their mobile
   devices capabilities, availability, and usage. A prototype of the
   middleware is developed and three scenarios are described to demonstrate
   how the middleware performs in adapting the provision of cloud web
   services by transforming SOAP messages to REST and XML format to JSON,
   in optimizing the results by extracting relevant information, and in
   improving the availability by caching. Initial analysis shows that the
   mobile cloud middleware improves the quality of service for mobiles, and
   provides lightweight responses for mobile cloud services.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have indicated that computing technology can enable
   off-site cardiologists to read patients' electrocardiograph (ECG),
   echocardiography (ECHO), and relevant images via smart phones during
   pre-hospital, in-hospital, and post-hospital teleconsultation, which not
   only identifies emergency cases in need of immediate treatment, but also
   prevents the unnecessary re-hospitalizations. Meanwhile, several studies
   have combined cloud computing and mobile computing to facilitate better
   storage, delivery, retrieval, and management of medical files for
   telecardiology. In the future, the aggregated ECG and images from
   hospitals worldwide will become big data, which should be used to
   develop an e-consultation program helping on-site practitioners deliver
   appropriate treatment. With information technology, real-time
   tele-consultation and tele-diagnosis of ECG and images can be practiced
   via an e-platform for clinical, research, and educational purposes.
   While being devoted to promote the application of information technology
   onto telecardiology, we need to resolve several issues: (1) data
   confidentiality in the cloud, (2) data interoperability among hospitals,
   and (3) network latency and accessibility. If these challenges are
   overcome, tele-consultation will be ubiquitous, easy to perform,
   inexpensive, and beneficial. Most importantly, these services will
   increase global collaboration and advance clinical practice, education,
   and scientific research in cardiology.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of ICT towards fast and robust data exchange promoted the
   blooming of successful technical and business concepts like cloud
   computing and virtualisation of enterprise assets. The escalation of
   service providers enabled the specialisation of enterprises
   (particularly SMEs) and the building of provider networks. This move
   from enterprise-concentric to service-dispersed strategies is leading to
   concerns about reaching and maintaining the interoperability between
   customer-provider pairs and their associated business networks. This is
   particularly true in the aerospace industry: a highly-competitive and
   demanding business supported by numerous applications, which may be
   general-purposed, specific, proprietary or open-sourced, all needing to
   be interoperable with the lowest impact on the business itself. This
   paper addresses the need for improving the sustainability of enterprise
   interoperability via the application of negotiations, with the objective
   of reducing the impact of changes and achieving the best solutions in
   the interoperability between the enterprises and their surrounding
   environment. It proposes a framework that features a negotiation
   mechanism for the management of changes towards the sustainability of
   the seamless business-to-business interactions, and describes its
   application on the real business case of the ESA-CDF space mission

   components are designed using the cloud component model approach that
   comprises of loosely coupled components that communicate asynchronously.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we leverage the previous work on the SHIWA bundling
   format and expand on this specification in order to facilitate workflow
   execution within a multi-workflow environment. We introduce a scalable
   and robust execution pool environment that supports workflows consisting
   of sub-workflows built upon a multitude of different workflow engines
   and environments, and also provide a common workflow representation for
   seamless connectivity through serialization to workflow bundles. We also
   present a meta-workflow scenario based upon this system. Workflow
   bundles employ the lightweight Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and
   Exchange (ORE) Web-based standard, to provide a common format for
   representing and sharing workflows and the associated metadata required
   for their execution. This generalized bundling approach is already
   available within five workflow engines and has proven a useful
   environment for inter-workflow experimentation. The execution pool
   facilitates federated access to multiple distributed computing
   infrastructures supported by the underlying workflow engines subscribed
   to the pool. Workflow bundles are exposed using the eXtensible Messaging
   and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which provides the necessary communication
   backbone to enable multiple workflow engine agents to asynchronously
   publish and subscribe to bundles in meta-workflow pipelines. We present
   experiments showing the scalability and robustness of the pool execution
   approach with results showing that overheads remain controlled for up to
   150 workflow agents, and that agent failures have very limited impact.
   We then demonstrate the applicability of our architecture by describing
   how a Java-based music analysis workflow can be distributed within such
   a multi-workflow environment consisting of the Triana and MOTEUR
   workflow engines.}},

Abstract = {{Whilst cloud computing has burst into the current scene as a technology
   that allows companies to access high computing rates at limited costs,
   cloud vendors have rushed to provide tools that allow developers to
   build software for their cloud platforms. The software developed with
   these tools is often tightly coupled to their services and restrictions.
   Consequently vendor lock in becomes a common problem which multiple
   cloud users have to tackle in order to exploit the full potential of
   cloud computing. A scenario where component-based applications are
   developed for being deployed across several clouds, and each component
   can in,dependently be deployed in one cloud or another, remains
   fictitious due to the complexity and the cost of their development. This
   paper presents a cloud development framework for developing cloud
   agnostic applications that may be deployed indifferently across multiple
   cloud platforms. Information about cloud deployment and cloud
   integration is separated from the source code and managed by the
   framework Interoperability between interdependent components deployed in
   different clouds is achieved by automatically generating services and
   service clients. This allows software developers to segment their
   applications into different modules that can easily be deployed and
   redistributed across heterogeneous cloud platforms. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sensors and actuators are the fundamental constituents of a cyber
   physical system (CPS). Pervasiveness of the sensors, requirement of
   collaborative processing of data, historical importance of data, and the
   ever increasing different forms of user applications are not only making
   data management more complex, but are also bringing more challenges for
   the scalability of a CPS. On the other hand, the requirement of bringing
   actuators to complete the feedback loop of a CPS is making it even more
   complex. There are three stages of complexities associated with
   scalability: in the phyical infrastructure of the data acquisition
   system, in the communication mechanism, and in the server and user
   applications. In all these stages, diversity, interoperability and
   individual capacity limitations of components play an important role in
   establishing the overall scalability limits of the CPS. In this paper we
   will systematically study how these parameters affect the scalability
   limits. Furthermore, we will also study the existing technologies (e.g.
   of big data and cloud) which can be used for addressing the challenges
   of scalability imposed at different stages of futuristic cyber physical
   systems.}},

   advancements have triggered international leaders and organizations to
   rethink geosciences and Digital Earth in the new decade. The next
   generation visions pose grand challenges for infrastructure, especially
   computing infrastructure. The gradual establishment of cloud computing
   as a primary infrastructure provides new capabilities to meet the

   to address geoscience and Digital Earth needs within the context of an
   integrated Earth system. We also introduce the five papers selected
   through a rigorous review process as exemplar research in using cloud
   capabilities to address the challenges. The literature and research
   demonstrate that spatial cloud computing provides unprecedented new
   capabilities to enable Digital Earth and geosciences in the twenty-first
   century in several aspects: (1) virtually unlimited computing power for
   addressing big data storage, sharing, processing, and knowledge
   discovering challenges, (2) elastic, flexible, and easy-to-use computing

Abstract = {{Ever since the introduction of computerized digital switching systems
   and related management systems, network operators have been struggling
   with the question of how to circumvent the issues of customized and
   proprietary network management solutions. This topic became of paramount
   importance to network equipment manufacturers and telecommunications
   service providers with the advent of the SDH and TMN standards in the
   late 1980s and early 1990s. It is in the context of this problem that
   the authors and their colleagues, as telecom standards experts,
   discovered the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP).
   This paper describes the approach taken by the authors and their
   colleagues to use RM-ODP to these issues in the ITU-T study groups, how
   those efforts were applied and the relevance of RM-ODP to current
   computing systems based on the concepts of Cloud Computing. This paper

Abstract = {{One of the problems of the Spanish Public Health National System is the
   lack of interoperability in the implemented Electronic Health Records
   (EHRs) systems in primary and specialty care. There is a deficiency in
   the electronic health systems that store the data of primary care
   patients, so one of the basic problems that prevent that every hospital
   and health center working on the same method is that deficiency. In this
   paper we research on this problem and to give expression to a series of
   solutions to it. Bibliographic material in this work has been obtained
   mainly from MEDLINE source. Additionally, due to the lack of information
   and privacy about the different EHRs systems, we have resorted to making
   direct contact with the organizations that have implemented those
   systems and technological providers. Two solutions have been propounded
   given several aspects for a feasibility study. The first solution is
   based upon in the execution of backups in different EHRs databases,
   which implies a huge economical and infrastructure development. The
   second of these solutions so that due to the creation of protocols by
   means of Cloud Computing Technologies. It is crucial the need to reach a
   homogeneity concerning to the storage of patients clinical data. On the
   results achieved we can emphasize that maybe the main problems are not
   the economical handicaps or the large technological development needed,
   but, as for Health each Region manages its own competences, each one
   governs with independent policies and decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Today's manufacturing enterprises struggle to adopt cost-effective
   manufacturing systems. Overview of the recent manufacturing enterprises
   shows that successful global manufacturing enterprises have distributed
   their manufacturing capabilities over the globe. The successes of global
   manufacturing enterprises depend upon the entire worldwide integration
   of their product development processes and manufacturing operations that
   are distributed over the globe. Distributed manufacturing agents'
   collaboration and manufacturing data integrity play a major role in
   global manufacturing enterprises' success. There are number of works,
   conducted to enable the distributed manufacturing agents to collaborate
   with each other. To achieve the manufacturing data integrity through
   manufacturing processes, numbers of solutions have been proposed which
   one of the successful solutions is to use ISO 10303 (STEP) standard.
   However, adopting this standard one can recognize antonym effects of
   integration and collaboration approaches that weaken both integration
   and collaboration capabilities of manufacturing agents. In our latest
   work, we had developed an integrated and collaborative manufacturing
   platform named LAYMOD. Albeit the platform in question was through
   enough to be applied in various collaborative and integrated CAx
   systems, its embedded structure hampers its application for
   collaboration in distributed manufacturing systems. To achieve an
   integrated and collaborative platform for distributed manufacturing
   agents, this paper proposes a service-oriented approach. This approach
   is originated from cloud computing paradigm known as one of the
   technologies which enables a major transformation in manufacturing
   industry. Also, to maintain the product data integration based on the
   STEP standard, a new service-oriented approach is proposed. This
   approach is in parallel to the new capability of the STEP standard for
   supporting XML data structures. The result is a new platform named
   XMLAYMOD. XMLAYMOD is able to support distributed manufacturing
   collaboration and data integration based on the STEP standard. The
   different aspects of this platform to fulfill the requirements of
   distributed collaboration and also to overcome the lacks of the STEP
   standard are discussed through a brief case study. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has become the most attractive technology in distributed
   computing and a variety of cloud services have been introduced. However,
   there is still no widely accepted standard format to satisfy cloud
   service providers and users requests. Consequently, it caused the issue
   of interoperability among them. This paper proposes a cloud service
   orchestration protocol based on multicast. This protocol separates the
   network view of service information and the application view of service
   information when exchanging service information to support
   interoperability and it uses multicast at various point of protocol to
   support scalability. Cloud system may have a lot of services and users
   to communicate with each other. Hence, there are some needs for
   effective transfer method and the multicast is one of the ideal
   solutions for this problem. This protocol helps to interoperate with
   various cloud services like web services and embedded devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the system developed to promote the rational use of
   electric energy among consumers and, thus, increase the energy
   efficiency. The goal is to provide energy consumers with an application
   that displays the energy consumption/production profiles, sets up
   consuming ceilings, defines automatic alerts and alarms, compares
   anonymously consumers with identical energy usage profiles by region and
   predicts, in the case of non-residential installations, the expected
   consumption/production values. The resulting distributed system is
   organized in two main blocks: front-end and back-end. The front-end
   includes user interface applications for Android mobile devices and Web
   browsers. The back-end provides data storage and processing
   functionalities and is installed in a cloud computing platform -the
   Google App Engine - which provides a standard Web service interface.
   This option ensures interoperability, scalability and robustness to the
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of Cloud Computing as a new business model has induced the
   proliferation of platform providers. However, the platform as-a-service
   (PaaS) concept still has several drawbacks to address before it can
   become widely used. In fact, PaaS involves some risks of vendor lock-in
   and compatibility restrictions if applications to deploy require
   proprietary or specific hosting frameworks such as applications based on
   Service Component Architecture (SCA) specifications. In this paper, we
   introduce a new approach to provision appropriate platform resources in
   order to host and deploy SCA-based applications on Cloud platforms. Our
   approach consists of slicing SCA-based applications to different
   services and then deploying them on our already developed service
   micro-containers. Our approach is a PaaS-independent approach that
   allows developers to deploy SCA-based applications on the target PaaS
   regardless of the platform capabilities. We motivate our solution with
   real use case scenario to show its feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{The original Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) model was developed
   in the early 90's, with revisits in 1998, and 2004. Today, with new
   technologies of big data, cloud computing, and machine analytics, there
   is an ever increasing need for integration of people and machines. The
   original JDL model focused on the data fusion (correlation, filtering,
   and association) issues, while today there is an increasing emphasis on
   an integrated approach to information exploitation over sensors, users,
   and missions using enterprise architectures, interoperability standards,
   and intelligence to the edge. Given these recent changes to computation
   and distributed access, we examine ways for extending the JDL model from
   1998 to support exploitation functions and information management for
   situation awareness, massive data analytics for contextual awareness,
   and domain-specific needs for mission awareness.}},

Abstract = {{The popularity of teleradiology services has enabled a major advance in
   the provision of health services to areas with difficult geographical
   access. However, this potential has also brought with it a number of
   challenges: the large volume of data, characteristic of imaging tests,
   and security requirements designed to ensure confidentiality and
   integrity. Moreover, there is also a number of ethical questions
   involving the dominant model on the market, whereby this service is
   out-sourced to private companies, and is not directly undertaken by
   professional radiologists. Therefore, the present paper proposes a
   cooperative model of teleradiology, where health professionals interact
   directly with the hospitals providing patient care. This has involved
   the integration of a wide range of technologies, such as the
   interconnection models Peer-to-Peer, Cloud Computing, Dynamic DNS,
   RESTful Web Services, as well as security and interoperability
   standards, with the aim of promoting a secure, collaborative
   asynchronous environment. The developed model is currently being used on
   an experimental basis, providing teleradiology support to cities in the
   north-eastern hinterland of Brazil, and is fulfilling all expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Data and Internet services have become ubiquitous, and the recent trend
   of building massive cloud datacenters is part of the current network
   evolution. The success of Internet of Things (IoT) will not so much
   depend on the development of new technologies, but rather on connecting
   and integrating existing resources. The paper proposes a novel
   architecture that enables objects to exchange information through the
   Internet to achieve nonintrusive behavior and customized services based
   on an open source cloud platform. To achieve this goal, the information
   driven interactions are done not only in a peer to peer method, but also
   via advanced cloud services. The result is a generic platform where
   devices, systems and services will take part in a heterogeneous and
   decentralized architecture. We demonstrate that IoT is all about
   interoperability, from connected cloud computing using RFID, NFC, M2M
   and sensor technology to digital content and context-aware services. We
   conclude our cloud of things vision by expanding on the need for
   interoperability of cloud and IoT.}},

   a degree of decoupling, SOA encourages the use of standardized transport
   schemes such as SOAP/HTTP(s) with WS family of standards specifications
   (commonly referred to as WS-{*} (WS-star)) to ease the interoperability
   complexity and security concerns in enterprise networks, which have
   medium/high bandwidth and reliable/wired networks. However, these
   protocol standards are ill suited for mobile devices due to their
   limited computational capabilities, low bandwidth, and intermittent
   connectivity. In this paper, we present an analysis of WS-{*} standards,
   classifying and discussing their inter-dependencies to provide a basis
   for determining the limitation of mobile device use in SOA and for
   establishing an architectural consideration baseline for selecting
   appropriate security mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The different implementations of cloud computing services developed by
   each cloud vendor have resulted in a heterogeneity of APIs and libraries
   which most developers of cloud-based applications must fight to
   understand. This so called vendor lock-in effect leads to a substantial
   increment on the development effort required to switch the initially
   selected cloud service used by an application to a different one.
   Different initiatives have emerged to solve this problem, such as
   standardization attempts, and intermediate systems or middlewares.
   Instead, our approach makes use software adaptation techniques for
   tackling the vendor lock-in problem and facilitating the development of
   cloud applications that are not coupled to any specific platform. In
   this paper, a case study application is presented in order to illustrate
   how the vendor lock-in effect appears and to make an estimation of the
   effort required for its migration to a different platform. This way we
   show the benefits of our approach for reducing the cloud service
   migration efforts. Such solution is sketched briefly, and the main steps
   of the adaptation process are described.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing generally involves the use of data storage and
   computational resources from external providers. Although a number of
   commercial providers are currently on the market, it is often beneficial
   for a user to consider capability from a number of different ones. This
   would prevent vendor lock-in and more economic choice for a user. Based
   on this observation, work on ``Social Clouds{''} has involved using
   social relationships formed between individuals and institutions to
   establish Peer-2-Peer resource sharing networks, enabling market forces
   to determine how demand for resources can be met by a number of
   different (often individually owned) providers. In this paper we
   identify how trading within such a network could be enhanced by the
   dynamic emergence (or identification) of brokers - based on their social
   position in the network (based on connectivity metrics within a social
   network). We investigate how offering financial incentives to such
   brokers, once discovered, could help improve the number of trades that
   could take place with a network. A social score algorithm is described
   and simulated with PeerSim to validate our approach. We also compare the
   approach to a distributed dominating set algorithm - the closest
   approximation to our approach.}},

Abstract = {{In the landscape of cloud computing, the competition between providers
   has led to an ever growing number of cloud solutions offered to
   consumers. The ability to run and manage multi-cloud systems (i.e.,
   applications on multiple clouds) allows exploiting the peculiarities of
   each cloud solution and hence optimising the performance, availability,
   and cost of the applications. However, these cloud solutions are
   typically heterogeneous and the provided features are often
   incompatible. This diversity hinders the proper exploitation of the full
   potential of cloud computing, since it prevents interoperability and
   promotes vendor lock-in, as well as it increases the complexity of
   development and administration of multi-cloud systems. This problem
   needs to be addressed promptly. In this paper, we provide a
   classification of the state-of-the-art of cloud solutions, and argue for
   the need for model-driven engineering techniques and methods
   facilitating the specification of provisioning, deployment, monitoring,
   and adaptation concerns of multi-cloud systems at design-time and their
   enactment at run-time.}},

Abstract = {{Population aging in the world causes medical expenses to soar.
   Preventive health care attracts people and government's close attention.
   Integrated electronic health records (EHRs) and Personal Health Records
   (PHRs) play a crucial role in providing continuous health care.
   Although, IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) has developed the
   XDS (Cross Enterprise Document Sharing) integration profile for sharing
   clinical documents among computer systems in healthcare, the XDS
   integration profile may not directly support cloud computing
   environments where repository systems are heterogeneous and virtualized.
   In this paper, we propose a PHR cloud system architecture based on the
   cloud computing Service Model defined by the National Institute of
   Standards and Technology (NIST), and adopt the IHE XDS integration
   profile for system interoperability. To enhance computation power and
   system scalability we include Hadoop parallel computing model and
   implement a NoSQL storage layer in this PHR cloud architecture. Our
   approach presented here to PHR Systems Cloud architecture could be a
   paradigm for sharing documents in health care settings and supporting
   cloud computing as well.}},

Abstract = {{Big data storage is a considerable challenge for IT organizations. Cloud
   providers promote using cloud storage for this purpose. However, vendor
   lock-in problem prevents organizations to migrate toward cloud storage.
   An evident solution is to distribute redundant data across multiple
   cloud providers in order to increase the probability of access to data.
   This paper analyses such a solution that uses erasure coding as a method
   of distribution. We study the effect of system parameters such as
   failure rate, redundancy ratio and number of initial block on data
   access. We show that the probability of access to data varies
   logarithmically in terms of time and number of initial block. Further
   increasing redundancy ratio is not always effective.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Database Management System is a new emerging concept recently
   introduced in the world. in Cloud the concept of Standard architecture
   of Cloud Database Management System is not yet been implemented. in this
   paper we are proposing a framework for 5-layered architecture in cloud
   database management system. First layer introduced is the External
   Layer, this layer is closest to the user, in which manageability,
   providing transparency and security are the important issue that should
   be considered. Second layer is the Conceptual Middleware Layer, as there
   are heterogeneous databases and clouds are available in the market, so
   here interoperability is the major issue. Third layer is the Conceptual
   Layer in which programming techniques, transaction management, query
   processing and optimization are the issues that should be considered.
   Forth layer is the Physical Middleware Layer, as there are various
   platforms available so here also, interoperability between various
   platforms are the biggest issue and the last layer is the Physical Layer
   in which how data can be stored so that it can be easily accessible
   without so much overhead so here data security, storage, backup, load
   balancing, partitioning, scaling, elasticity, fault tolerance and
   replication are the important issues that should be considered. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents on-going research to develop the Intercloud
   Architecture Framework (ICAF) that addresses problems in multi-provider
   multi-domain heterogeneous cloud based infrastructure services and
   applications integration and interoperability, to allow their on-demand
   provisioning. The paper refers to existing standards and ongoing
   standardisation activity in Cloud Computing, in particular, recently
   published NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (CCRA) and ITU-T
   JCA-Cloud activity. The proposed ICAF defines four complementary
   components addressing Intercloud integration and interoperability:
   multi-layer Cloud Services Model that combines commonly adopted cloud
   service models, such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, in one multilayer model with
   corresponding inter-layer interfaces; Intercloud Control and Management
   Plane that supports cloud based applications interaction; Intercloud
   Federation Framework, and Intercloud Operations Framework. The paper
   briefly describes the Service delivery and lifecycle management as an
   important ICAF component that provides a basis for consistent management
   and security of the provisioned on-demand complex cloud based services.
   The paper describes an implementation of the Intercloud Control and
   Management Plane in the GEYSERS project to allow optimal provisioning of
   the combined Network+IT resources in the inter-cloud environment. The
   proposed architecture is intended to provide an architectural model for
   developing Intercloud middleware and in this way will facilitate clouds
   interoperability and integration.}},

Abstract = {{Today, different cloud providers are used; many companies don't want to
   be tied to one provider and should use more than one. Consequently,
   there is a need for ensuring data portability between the clouds because
   of the data in the cloud must be shared and manipulated by multiple
   applications on multiple platforms. In this paper, we'll propose an
   agent-based architecture that facilitates collaboration among Cloud
   providers. We'll also aim to overcome the lock-in issues in Cloud
   computing, and try to ensure the data portability between the providers.
   Our architecture is based on mobile agents that allow researching,
   collecting and transferring data from one cloud to another one by their
   ability to move between different environments.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic Interoperability is one of the most important open challenges
   in the Knowledge Management field. In this work, we propose a framework
   for making easier information exchanging operations among heterogeneous
   information sources, over the Cloud. Exploiting the Semantic Web
   technologies, the framework has the objective of allowing semantic
   interoperability among distributed software agents preserving not only
   semantics of transmitted messages, but also the subjectivity of agent's
   world vision in the communication process. The proposed system, in fact,
   will help users in the digital documents exchanging activities by
   extracting the related relevant information and coding their informative
   contents in a shape capable of preserving the original semantics, also
   in the case of communications agents using different or incompatible
   vocabularies.
   The framework is a an evolution of semantic interoperable methodologies
   towards cloud computer technologies, thus guaranteeing several
   advantages in terms of usability, scalability and fault tolerance.
   In particular, we implemented a prototype that provides interoperability
   functionalities in the E-Health domain, managing information coming from
   heterogeneous sources.}},

Abstract = {{Each year, a number of natural disasters strike across the globe,
   killing hundreds and causing billions of dollars in property and
   infrastructure damage. Minimizing the impact of disasters is imperative
   in today's society. As the capabilities of software and hardware evolve,
   so does the role of information and communication technology in disaster
   mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery. A large quantity of
   disaster-related data is available, including response plans, records of
   previous incidents, simulation data, social media data, and Web sites.
   However, current data management solutions offer few or no integration
   capabilities. Moreover, recent advances in cloud computing, big data,
   and NoSQL open the door for new solutions in disaster data management.
   In this paper, a Knowledge as a Service (KaaS) framework is proposed for
   disaster cloud data management (Disaster-CDM), with the objectives of 1)
   storing large amounts of disaster-related data from diverse sources, 2)
   facilitating search, and 3) supporting their interoperability and
   integration. Data are stored in a cloud environment using a combination
   of relational and NoSQL databases. The case study presented in this
   paper illustrates the use of Disaster-CDM on an example of simulation
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing as a service-on-demand architecture has grown in
   importance over the previous few years. One driving force of its growth
   is the ever increasing amount of data which is supposed to outpace the
   growth of storage capacity. This way, public cloud storage services
   enable organizations to manage their data with low operational expenses.
   However, the benefits of cloud computing come along with challenges and
   open issues such as security, reliability and the risk to become
   dependent on a provider for its service. In general, a switch of a
   storage provider is associated with high costs of adapting new APIs and
   additional charges for inbound and outbound bandwidth and requests. In
   this paper, we describe the design, architecture and implementation of
   Cloud-RAID, a system that improves availability, confidentiality and
   integrity of data stored in the cloud. To achieve this objective, we
   encrypt user's data and make use of the RAID-technology principle to
   manage data distribution across cloud storage providers. Our approach
   allows users to avoid vendor lock-in, and reduce significantly the cost
   of switching providers. In general, the data distribution is based on
   users' expectations regarding providers geographic location, quality of
   service, providers reputation, and budget preferences. In this paper, we
   also discuss the security functionality and reveal our observations on
   the overall performance when encrypting and encoding user's data.}},

   offerings, both commercial and academic, to evaluate their potential for
   improving the turnaround time for application results. Since the target
   application does not fit well into existing computational paradigms for
   the cloud, we employ parallel scripting tool, as a first step toward a
   broader program of adapting portable, scalable computational tools for
   use as enablers of the future smart grids. We use multiple clouds as a
   way to reassure potential users that the risk of cloud-vendor lock-in

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing facilitates the new generation of IT and the
   provisioning of services by introducing virtualization concepts
   throughout the network. Multi-tenancy introduces the capability to share
   cloud assets among service users. Service providers currently lack
   innovative means to enable true multi-tenancy in a cloud environment.
   There is an urgent need for technologies that introduce tenant security,
   traffic identification and tenant separation for better billing and
   fairness. This paper introduces a technology that tackles all these
   requirements by defining the concept of a Tenant-ID that is incorporated
   into the OSI Layer 2 frame header. We outline the concept of Tenant-IDs,
   the adapted 802.1q header and a way to automatically configure tenants
   via Cloud automation tools and software-defined networking approaches.
   The paper concludes by outlining interoperability to relevant layer-2
   protocols and by introducing use-cases benefiting from the Tenant-ID
   concept.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing in many ways can be viewed as both a technology offering
   and a business alternative. But its adoption today is driven more by
   economic rationale than by technology justifications. Though in delivery
   terms, cloud offering is a merger of state-of-the-art concepts like
   virtualization, server consolidation, interoperability and dynamic CPU
   provisioning, its risk-benefit analysis is purely driven by business
   imperatives. As a technology, Cloud Computing topped the Gartner's Hype
   Cycle only as late as 2009. However since then the hype has settled down
   and `computing in the ethereal cloud' is slowly emerging as a strong
   cost-effective alternative to traditional computing. This paper focuses
   on the customer side perceptions of cloud adoption with a purely
   India-centric perspective. Since cloud is a fairly new offering, there
   is bound to be a lot of inertia in its acceptance. This is because cloud
   offerings - from the product development lifecycle (PDLC) point of view
   - are at a nascent stage and hence perceived risks outweigh perceived
   gains. This paper focusses on the cloud adoption risks across four
   sectors - SME, BFS, Education and Hospitals. The four key risk
   categories identified in the context of cloud adoption are vendor
   related risk, security related risk, no-gain risk and efficiency related
   risk. The paper does a relative mapping of these four risks for each of
   the four mentioned industry clusters. Since cloud technology is only in
   the process of getting established and main stream adoption is still a
   few years away, many of the cloud adoption fears are nebulous and will
   be removed once critical volumes start building up. Till such a
   maturation happens, cloud vendors will have to assiduously work out ways
   and means of assuaging the fears that inhibit adoption real or
   perceptional. This paper is posited to be a pointer in that direction.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has seen a tremendous growth in the last five years.
   Along with the growth, many cloud models have been marketed. They
   deliver hardware and software as virtualization enabled services to
   users. Although cloud computing offers considerable advantages such as
   unlimited resources, manageability and lower investment costs but there
   are still barriers to exploit it. One of the barriers is the
   difficulties, which users are being faced when developing and deploying
   their own services into clouds. In this paper, we present a novel
   approach for developing interoperable services that can be deployed in
   different cloud infrastructures at the same time. The approach provides
   an instrument with emphasis on abstraction, inheritance and code reuse.
   Using the approach, cloud-based services are developed easily by
   extending existing abstractions classes provided by the instrument or
   other developers. The interoperability between different clouds is
   solved via the basic abstraction class of the instrument and all
   services are inherited and benefited from this advantage.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has paved the way for advance of IT-based on demand
   services. This technology helps decrease capital expenditure and
   operation costs, solve scalability issue and many more user and provider
   constraints. However, development and deployment of distributed
   applications on cloud environment becomes a more and more complex task.
   Cloud users must spend a lot of time to prepare, install and configure
   their applications on clouds. In addition, after development and
   deployment, the applications almost cannot move from one cloud to
   another due to the lack of interoperability between them. To address
   these problems, in this paper we present a novel development and
   deployment framework for cloud distributed applications/services. Our
   approach is based on abstraction and object-oriented programming
   technique, allowing users to easily and rapidly develop and deploy their
   services into cloud environment. The approach also enables service
   migration and interoperability among the clouds.}},

Abstract = {{The popularity of the modeling and simulation application increases the
   demand for acquiring the service of the simulation resource and
   capability (R/C) anytime, anywhere, on demand through the network. Cloud
   simulation draws the idea of cloud computing that integrates and shares
   the R/Cs to provide services which significantly depending on the R/Cs'
   management. Most existing work assumes that there is only one management
   center, and some existing work uses master-slave management
   architecture. Both of them cannot provide services reliably in the wide
   area network. The relevant work in cloud computing deploys datacenters
   scatted and executes the distributed scheduling reliably. However, it
   does not take the limited R/C constraint and the parallel
   interoperability of the sub-tasks into account which are unique in
   simulation field. Our goal is to re-design an architecture of R/Cs'
   management with multi-centers in wide area. We also propose a
   mathematical model for the cross-centric global optimized allocation of
   R/C services. The model includes the factors of the availability of R/C
   service and the remote collaborative cost among sub-tasks. We show the
   model achieves desirable effect in the utilization balance of R/Cs and
   the reduction of the collaborative cost by experiment compared with an
   existing decentralized model.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we combine the field of cloud computing with assisted
   living to utilize an improved activity classification. The proposed
   system addresses the challenge of enabling heterogeneous, cloud-based
   sensors in small home environments. With a semantic and model-based
   approach, we seamlessly integrate web services as virtual sensors and,
   therefore, increasing the accuracy of human activity classifiers. We
   solve the most important compelling issue of interoperability, by using
   generated wrapper classes and semantically unify all heterogeneous
   sensor events within the system. Our approach is evaluated with a test
   installation by means of the requirements for Sensor Web Infrastructures
   combined with the one for assisted living environments.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the heterogeneity of today's cloud providers, migrating
   applications between providers is extremely challenging. This lack of
   portability is caused, in part, by vendor lock-in: the strong dependency
   created between a cloud user and a cloud provider since the cloud user
   deploys their software on a specific cloud platform. This paper outlines
   our plans to address vendor lock-in by applying techniques from the area
   of model-driven engineering (MDE), a contemporary and principled
   approach to software engineering that has sometimes been used to achieve
   greater portability of software. This paper presents preliminary models
   of two widely used IaaS services and an analysis of literature reporting
   real cases of software migration, and introduces a research question and
   method for our future work on using MDE to address vendor lock-in for
   cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on two aspects related to the widespread of cloud
   computing: first, the definition of a common formalism, based on a
   unique and shared model, which could be used to completely describe
   Cloud patterns; second, the investigation of a methodology to automatize
   the recognition of similar elements in Design and Cloud patterns, thus
   defining an automatic mapping among representations of application that
   follow these patterns. These aspects are handled on one hand by
   extending an existing semantic based Design pattern language in order to
   properly represent both Design and Cloud patterns together with its
   possible related architectural implementations and on the other hand by
   using these agnostic representations to define a mapping between Design
   patterns ( a single design pattern or a composition of pattern) and
   Cloud patterns, in order to obtain a clear model of the cloud
   applications which could satisfy its original requirements and exploit
   all the benefits of cloud computing at the same time.}},

   application and platform portability and interoperability, and can

   studies that describe the state-of-the-art in managing cloud lock-in,
   portability and interoperability. 78 of these primary studies were
   selected and used for a thorough analysis of cloud standards, commercial
   products and academic work related to cloud lock-in. Our review shows
   that most solutions proposed so far are platforms, APIs or architectures
   addressing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) interoperability. From our
   review, we identify a need for: (i) exploiting established solutions
   from areas that are closely related to cloud computing; (ii) increasing
   empirical evidence to raise confidence in existing solutions; and (iii)
   addressing the socio-technical and business challenges related to cloud

   was introduced the ``thin device{''} concept which allows to move the
   traditional ticketing operations to cloud platform, allowing that way to
   increase elasticity and interoperability issues.
   The device created is a prototype of this validation ticketing device
   with the validation services in a cloud platform (Amazon Web Services).
   Physically, the prototype consists in validator running on a tablet with

   model also suggests that the scale of the company may moderate the
   effects of above trust factors on the trust in the adoption of CIOS. The
   proposed trust model aims to help the cloud computing service providers
   to understand the trust factors that will affect users' trust in the
   adoption of CIOS. So that cloud computing service providers can adjust
   their strategies for providing successful cloud computing services. It
   also provides a base for further research on the trust models for the

   without the need for a dedicated infrastructure, dependencies
   installation or server configuration. However, each PaaS provider
   generates a lock-in to their proprietary features, technologies or APIs
   (Application Programming Interfaces). This paper focuses on the
   specification, development and test of an abstraction layer that aims to
   unify the management and information processes of applications and
   databases created in PaaS environments, in order to struggle the
   existing lock-in in the market. As result, PaaS users will have now the
   opportunity for selecting the most appropriate platform for an
   application, interacting seamlessly with any supported vendor, also
   having the opportunity to attain the portability of applications among
   distinct PaaS providers. As far as we know, this is the first work in
   this research area presenting a real implemented and tested system
   aggregating several PaaS offerings.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has the promise of significant benefits that include
   reduced costs, improved service provisioning, and a move to a
   pay-per-use model. However, there also are many challenges to
   successfully delivering cloud-based services; including security, data
   ownership, interoperability, service maturity and return on investment.
   These challenges need to be understood and managed before attempting to
   take advantage of what the cloud has to offer. In this paper we
   introduce a nine-step cloud life cycle that can be used for both the
   migration and the ongoing management of public, cloud-based services. A
   consortium of organizations using an open-innovation approach developed
   the life cycle. This paper describes each step of the life cycle in
   terms of the key challenges faced, and the recommended activities, with
   resultant outputs, needed to overcome them.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present a cloudlet architecture for
   dashboard in Cloud and Ubiquitous Manufacturing. In practice means that,
   with Cloud Computing adoption, Manufacturing requires management
   applications where ubiquity and effectiveness are enabled. If ubiquity
   and resources scalability, availability and capacity can be well
   supported by cloud, pragmatics instruments are required to support
   effectiveness. The architecture here presented shows the integration of
   enriched existing (cloud) services, as instances of resources, with
   layers of new services towards direct and synchronous communication
   between users. These Rich Internet Application (RIA) components, here
   named cloudlets, integration, follow dashboards organization patterns
   and will be supported by emergent web3.0 interaction technologies. In
   fact, the paper proposes a new Presentation Layer to be used in UMS and
   (that may be used) in any multi-layer cloud-based web application. (C)

Abstract = {{With the ever-changing dynamic Information and Communications Technology
   environment and the new shared deployment options for computing, a
   paradigm shift is occurring that enables ubiquitous and convenient
   computing on a pay-as-you-go basis. Access on demand is becoming
   available to networks of scalable, elastic, self-serviceable,
   configurable physical and virtual resources. On a more narrowly focused
   IT and business front, there is a parallel shift towards designing
   information systems in terms of the services available at an interface.
   The Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) development style is based on
   the design of services and processes and the realization of
   interoperability and location transparency in context-specific
   implementations. This paper analyzes the Cloud Computing and SOA
   Reference Architectures being developed by ISO ISO/IEC JTC1 SC38 (in
   collaboration with ITU-T SG13/WP6 for Cloud Computing), and offers a
   concept comparison using Fact Based Modeling (FBM) methodology. FBM has
   allowed us to distill the concepts, relationships and business rules -
   thereby exposing the strengths and weakness of each, and identifying the
   gaps between the two.}},

Abstract = {{Vital signs such as respiration and pulse and electrocardiography are
   crucial for monitoring disease and promoting health in the age of
   ubiquitous cloud computing. However, systems and devices that sense,
   process and analyse vital signs suffer from a lack of interoperability
   caused by differences in the platforms, devices and data formats used.
   Consequently, a particular vendor can provide a limited number of
   services, but users are not able to access more shared services. To
   counter these problems, this study proposes a service-oriented
   architecture for healthcare systems utilising vital signs. The proposed
   structure differs from the one used to handle business logics in
   general, because vital signs data are distinct from the types of data
   used in other enterprises. In this study, these data are expressed as
   the Health Level Seven standard schema, and the structure uses Object
   Constraint Language (OCL), a platform-independent specification
   language, to access the vital signs data and evaluate the state of
   health. In particular, the use of OCL enables a fast response to changes
   in service content and reduces maintenance costs.}},

Abstract = {{Emergency care is basically concerned with the provision of pre-hospital
   and in-hospital medical and/or paramedical services and it typically
   involves a wide variety of interdependent and distributed activities
   that can be interconnected to form emergency care processes within and
   between Emergency Medical Service (EMS) agencies and hospitals. Hence,
   in developing an information system for emergency care processes, it is
   essential to support individual process activities and to satisfy
   collaboration and coordination needs by providing readily access to
   patient and operational information regardless of location and time.
   Filling this information gap by enabling the provision of the right
   information, to the right people, at the right time fosters new
   challenges, including the specification of a common information format,
   the interoperability among heterogeneous institutional information
   systems or the development of new, ubiquitous trans-institutional
   systems. This paper is concerned with the development of an integrated
   computer support to emergency care processes by evolving and
   cross-linking institutional healthcare systems. To this end, an
   integrated EMS cloud-based architecture has been developed that allows
   authorized users to access emergency case information in standardized
   document form, as proposed by the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise
   (IHE) profile, uses the Organization for the Advancement of Structured
   Information Standards (OASIS) standard Emergency Data Exchange Language
   (EDXL) Hospital Availability Exchange (HAVE) for exchanging operational
   data with hospitals and incorporates an intelligent module that supports
   triaging and selecting the most appropriate ambulances and hospitals for

Abstract = {{In an age of cloud computing, users do not access a particular system,
   but a service. In a more centralized and seamless environment, it
   becomes important to view software as a service, or ``SaaS{''}. In
   particular, ubiquitous healthcare urgently needs to reflect the view of
   the healthcare system as a service, ``HaaS{''}, for the purposes of
   health promotion, disease prevention, and general well-being. Overcoming
   the current limitations of medical technologies, medical practices, and
   business, HaaS requires a more sustainable environment, including
   addressing issues of interoperability, service reuse, maintenance, and
   integration. This paper suggests a framework for realizing a HaaS model,
   focusing on vital signs-oriented systems. The proposed framework
   consists of four distinct modules: three modules for receiving,
   transforming, and analyzing vital signs and the fourth module, called a
   service-oriented architecture (SOA) component module, enabling access to
   medical services. We believe that the framework promises dramatic
   reductions in software development costs on the one hand and lays a
   foundation for users to access a rich and seamless service in a more
   convenient way on the other. This paper describes a framework for the
   HaaS model and presents an example service that we implemented, a
   calorie-tracking service, based on it. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We show how a layered Cloud service model of software (SaaS), platform
   (PaaS), and infrastructure (laaS) leverages multiple independent Clouds
   by creating a federation among the providers. The layered architecture
   leads naturally to a design in which inter-Cloud federation takes place
   at each service layer, mediated by a broker specific to the concerns of
   the parties at that layer. Federation increases consumer value for and
   facilitates providing IT services as a commodity. This business model
   for the Cloud is consistent with broker mediated supply and service
   delivery chains in other commodity sectors such as finance and
   manufacturing. Concreteness is added to the federated Cloud model by
   considering how it works in delivering the Weather Research and
   Forecasting service (WRF) as SaaS using PaaS and laaS support. WRF is
   used to illustrate the concepts of delegation and federation, the
   translation of service requirements between service layers, and
   inter-Cloud broker functions needed to achieve federation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{System management is becoming increasingly complex and brings high
   costs, especially with the advent of cloud computing. Cloud computing
   involves numerous platforms often of virtual machines (VMs) and
   middleware has to be managed to make the whole system work
   cost-effectively after an application is deployed. In order to reduce
   management costs, in particular for the manual activities, many computer
   programs have been developed remove or reduce the complexity and
   difficulty of system mamnagement. These programs are usually hard-coded
   in languages like Java and C++, which bring enough capability and
   flexibility but also cause high programming effort and cost. This paper
   proposes an architecture for developing management programs in a simple
   but powerful way. First of all, the manageability of a given platform
   (via APIs, configuration files, and scripts) is abstracted as a runtime
   model of the platform's software architecture, which can automatically
   and immediately propagate any observable runtime changes of the target
   platforms to the corresponding architecture models, and vice versa. The
   management programs are developed using modeling languages, instead of
   those relatively low-level programming languages. Architecture-level
   management programs bring many advantages related to performance,
   interoperability, reusability, and simplicity. An experiment on a
   real-world cloud deployment and comparisonwith traditional programming
   language approaches demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and
   benefits of the new model based approach for management program
   development.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to programming and running scientific
   applications on grid and cloud infrastructures based on two principles:
   the first one is to follow a component-based programming model, the
   second is to apply a flexible technology which allows for virtualization
   of the underlying infrastructure. The solutions described in this paper
   include high-level composition and deployment consisting of a
   scripting-based environment and a manager system based on an
   architecture description language (ADL), a dynamically managed pool of
   component containers, and interoperability with other component models
   such as Grid Component Model (GCM). We demonstrate how the proposed
   methodology can be implemented by combining the unique features of the
   Common Component Architecture (CCA) model together with the H2O resource
   sharing platform, resulting in the MOCCA component framework.
   Applications and tests include data mining using the Weka library, Monte
   Carlo simulation of the formation of clusters of gold atoms, as well as
   a set of synthetic benchmarks. The conclusion is that the component
   approach to scientific applications can be successfully applied to both
   grid and cloud infrastructures.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{175-183}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The properties of BIM are; parametric modelling providing tabular views
   of components and characteristic interaction with elements, for example
   if a pitch roof changes so do the walls and bi-directional co-ordination
   enabling virtual simulations of physical construction. However, the
   dilemma is how to share these properties of BIM applications on one
   single platform. Thus creating a service that would enable the end-user
   to use multiple of nDs such as, 3D (three dimensional modelling), 4D
   (time-programming), 50 (costing) and 6D (sustainability) actions
   asynchronously. The prospect of using remote data servers with web
   service applications provides a mechanism for exchanging data openly.
   The main exchange format for BIM files is Industry Foundation Classes
   (IFCs). However, the initial problem with IFCs is that they are not
   intended to store and carry all relevant data for all multi-featured
   construction processes. Furthermore, not all relevant data can be
   structured in a single super schema. This papers' methodology focuses on
   the results of a semi-structured interview of 11 expert respondents, on
   using cloud computing as integration platform for BIM applications
   `Cloud BIM'. The proposed model is not to introduce a new schema in
   contrast to IFC but to harness the capability of IFC XML and or possibly
   engage with using Simplified Markup Language (SML) subsets of eXtensible
   Markup Language (XML) for exchanging partial data to design an
   integrated platform that would enhance the BIM usability experience for
   various disciplines in making key design decisions at a relatively early
   design stage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of IF networks to a service-oriented paradigm poses new
   challenges to service providers regarding the management and auditing of
   network services. The upward trend in ubiquity, heterogeneity and
   virtualization of network services and resources demands for a formal
   and systematic approach to network management tasks.
   In this context, the semantic characterization and modeling of services
   provided to users is a key component to sustain autonomic service
   management, service negotiation and configuration. The semantic and
   formal description of services and resources is also relevant to assist
   paradigms such as cloud computing, where a large diversity of resources
   have to be described and managed in a highly dynamic way.
   This paper defines an ontology for multiservice IP networks targeting
   multiple service management goals, namely: (i) to foster client and
   service provider interoperability; (ii) to manage network service
   contracts, promoting the dynamic negotiation between parties; (iii) to
   access and query SLA/SLSs data on a individual or aggregated basis to
   assist service provisioning in the network; and (iv) to sustain service
   monitoring and auditing. A ServiceModel API is provided to take full
   advantage of the proposed semantic model, allowing Service Management
   Platforms to access the ontological contents. This ontological
   development takes advantage of SWRL to discover new knowledge, enriching
   the possibilities of systems described using this support. (C) 2012

Title = {{Tavaxy: Integrating Taverna and Galaxy workflows with cloud computing
   support}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Over the past decade the workflow system paradigm has
   evolved as an efficient and user-friendly approach for developing
   complex bioinformatics applications. Two popular workflow systems that
   have gained acceptance by the bioinformatics community are Taverna and
   Galaxy. Each system has a large user-base and supports an ever-growing
   repository of application workflows. However, workflows developed for
   one system cannot be imported and executed easily on the other. The lack
   of interoperability is due to differences in the models of computation,
   workflow languages, and architectures of both systems. This lack of
   interoperability limits sharing of workflows between the user
   communities and leads to duplication of development efforts.
   Results: In this paper, we present Tavaxy, a stand-alone system for
   creating and executing workflows based on using an extensible set of
   re-usable workflow patterns. Tavaxy offers a set of new features that
   simplify and enhance the development of sequence analysis applications:
   It allows the integration of existing Taverna and Galaxy workflows in a
   single environment, and supports the use of cloud computing
   capabilities. The integration of existing Taverna and Galaxy workflows
   is supported seamlessly at both run-time and design-time levels, based
   on the concepts of hierarchical workflows and workflow patterns. The use
   of cloud computing in Tavaxy is flexible, where the users can either
   instantiate the whole system on the cloud, or delegate the execution of
   certain sub-workflows to the cloud infrastructure.
   Conclusions: Tavaxy reduces the workflow development cycle by
   introducing the use of workflow patterns to simplify workflow creation.
   It enables the re-use and integration of existing (sub-) workflows from
   Taverna and Galaxy, and allows the creation of hybrid workflows. Its
   additional features exploit recent advances in high performance cloud
   computing to cope with the increasing data size and complexity of
   analysis. The system can be accessed either through a cloud-enabled
   web-interface or downloaded and installed to run within the user's local
   environment. All resources related to Tavaxy are available at
   http://www.tavaxy.org.}},

Abstract = {{In the past few years, we have witnessed the proliferation of a
   heterogeneous ecosystem of cloud providers, each one with a different
   infrastructure offer and pricing policy. We explore this heterogeneity
   in a novel cloud brokering approach that optimizes placement of virtual
   infrastructures across multiple clouds and also abstracts the deployment
   and management of infrastructure components in these clouds. The
   feasibility of our approach is evaluated in a high throughput computing
   cluster case study. Experimental results confirm that multi-cloud
   deployment provides better performance and lower costs compared to the
   usage of a single cloud only. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The importance of healthcare information technology has increased
   dramatically during the past few years. Researchers, developers, and
   companies have placed efforts to develop mobile, web, desktop, and
   enterprise e-health applications. This development raised the importance
   of interoperability and data exchange between e-health applications and
   Health Information Systems (HIS), which resulted in increased concerns
   for securing sensitive data and data exchange. This paper emphasizes
   standardizing a data exchange mechanism and interoperability between
   HISs and e-health applications across a cloud-based service. The
   proposed service provides a single point of entry for retrieving
   Electronic Medical Records (EMR) among the various HISs that a patient
   record is stored in and for any e-health application seeking such
   information. Moreover, this research proposes a unified secure platform
   that provides developers, health care providers, and organizations
   access to a framework to retrieve and manage medical records and
   Personal Health Records (PHR) among various subscribers. The proposed
   service and platform have been qualitatively evaluated among a sample of
   physicians, patients, and hospital administrators from the Faculty of
   Medicine, Alexandria University, Egypt. Results are promising and a
   prototype implementation is underway.}},

Abstract = {{Today, cloud computing is an attractive and cost-saving saving service
   for buyers as it provides accessibility and reliability options for
   users and scalable sales for providers. Before implementing this method
   of computing, however, it is important to consider the security of the

   traditional attacks to the cloud computing according to their origin and
   their category, as a solution to protect the cloud from these attacks,
   the IDS integrated in the cloud remains among the best solution,
   therefore we will show some existing cloud computing architecture based
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS), their strengths and weaknesses. For
   the comparative study between the architectures, we have adopted
   transparency, alerts analysis, authentication, accountability, dynamic
   reaction, centralized management, interoperability, deployability and
   control from front office side as criterion for comparison, as a result
   of this comparative study, we propose a new architecture in one hand by
   correcting some weaknesses and in the other hand integrating certain

Abstract = {{While the capability for growing on demand is the design foundation of
   the new generation of software platforms, physical systems always have
   limited resources. Therefore, there is a need to optimise the existing
   infrastructures and evolving them building on interoperability. The
   optimisation of the infrastructure entails not only addressing the
   computational and storage capabilities but also the network, its
   associated intelligence and the exchanged information. Therefore, the
   interoperability requirement in a large scale cyber-system spans from
   the lowest layers, interfacing with the physical resources, to the
   software building blocks, client devices and handled data. In this
   paper, several initiatives addressing interoperability among cloud IaaS
   layers, IaaS-PaaS, PaaS-SaaS, Cloud-Network and data are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents on-going research to develop the Intercloud
   Architecture Framework (ICAF) that addresses problems in multi-provider
   multi-domain heterogeneous cloud based infrastructure services and
   applications integration and interoperability. The paper refers to
   existing standards in Cloud Computing, in particular, recently published
   NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (CCRA). The proposed ICAF
   defines four complementary components addressing Intercloud integration
   and interoperability : multilayer Cloud Services Model that combines
   commonly adopted cloud service models, such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, in one
   multilayer model with corresponding inter-layer interfaces; Intercloud
   Control and Management Plane that supports cloud based applications
   interaction; Intercloud Federation Framework, and Intercloud Operation
   Framework. The paper briefly describes the architectural framework for
   cloud based infrastructure services provisioned on-demand being
   developed in the framework of the GEYSERS project that is used as a
   basis for building multilayer cloud services integration framework that
   allows optimized provisioning of both computing, storage and networking
   resources. The proposed architecture is intended to provide an
   architectural model for developing Intercloud middleware and in this way
   will facilitate clouds interoperability and integration.}},

Abstract = {{Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are generally known as open and free systems
   since resources are often contributed from voluntary participants. Their
   limitation, however, is that they only support simple resource sharing
   such as file (storage) sharing and bandwidth sharing. On the other hand,
   based on virtualization techniques, cloud computing provides a more
   flexible mechanism to share all types of resources with no limitations.
   Nevertheless, the use of cloud computing usually requires a fee and is
   often locked-in to services of cloud computing providers (i.e., vendor
   lock-in). In this paper, we aim to combine P2P and cloud computing
   technologies to design and develop PC2, an open and free cloud computing
   platform that allows users to participate in any time to contribute as
   well as to consume sharing resources. While this combination inherits
   good advantages of these two technologies, it also avoid their
   disadvantages. As a proof-of-concept, we have developed a prototype for
   PC2 based on Eucalyptus, the most popular open source for building cloud
   computing platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Though the current cloud computing is in its initial stage of
   development, some established players, such as Amazon, Google,
   Salesforce.com, have captured market shares with their own strategies
   and standards. However, for a further development for this immature
   market, it has been proposed a general standard (like TCP/IP for
   internet) among cloud participants. There are some standards under
   drafting, but it seems impractical for established players to agree on a
   general one, for they already have their own standards. What's more, the
   ongoing creation in the industry undermines standardization; On the
   other hand, each cloud provider is taking an active role in making its
   own API, for instance VMware's vCloud, an open standard, but the cost is
   consumers' lock-in. Thus, conversion technology seems to have a brighter
   future than standardization towards achieving interoperability.
   This study discusses various issues concerning the realization of
   interoperability by conversion technology. Primarily, an economic model
   is used for reference to analyze the market's incentive to adopt such
   technology, especially in such a market with network effects. Then a
   sequence of issues regarding technique, economy, management, security
   and politics are put forward and discussed, ending with an outlook for
   the industry. These discussions have important implications for
   realization of interoperability under the current condition where
   standardization is somewhat costly and impractical.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing (CC) is a promising next-generation computing paradigm
   providing network and computing resources on demand via the web. The
   cloud market is still in its infancy and all major issues, ranging from
   interoperability and standardization, to legislation and SLA contracts
   are still wide open. However, the main obstacle for a more catholic
   acceptance of the cloud model is security. In the CC model, the client
   has limited control over his data and computations as he outsources
   everything to the cloud provider. This basic CC feature influences
   several security related areas.
   In this paper, we investigate the impact that the CC model has on the
   digital forensics methodologies. Digital Forensics (DF) is the branch of
   computer science that develops evidence pertained in the digital world
   for use in civil or criminal court proceedings and this shared ownership
   of digital resources that the CC model inherits influences severely
   their analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Grid and cloud computing is a kind of important information technology
   which enables resource sharing globally to solve the large scale
   problem. Security plays very important role in any internet system,
   specifically in Grid and Cloud computing system. Since all the resources
   are shared in grid computing system, trust relationship is very crucial.
   Different domains have different policies in rendering their resources.
   Cloud Security combines parallel processing, grid computing, the
   judgment of unknown viruses and other emerging technologies and
   concepts, through the mass of the network client, detects status of all
   abnormal behavior and obtains the latest information of Trojans, viruses
   and other undesirable programs, sends information to the server for
   automatic analysis and processing, distributes solutions to each client
   to solve insecurity. This paper proposes an interoperability security
   protocol for both grid and cloud computing. There is no need for
   separate security protocol for grid and cloud computing environments.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is the next generation of computing paradigm. Along with
   cloud computing, many related problems come up. And these problems in
   turn slow the speed of the development of cloud computing down. Among
   these problems, e.g. interoperability and privacy, identity management
   and security are strong concerned. Many researchers and enterprises have
   already done a lot to optimize the identity management and strengthen
   the security in cloud computing. Most of these studies focus on the
   usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help
   improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new
   angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve
   many problems, it's adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The
   general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized
   component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with
   the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this
   centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper,
   we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management
   in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping
   algorithm as the deploy strategy. Security is another problem involved
   in this paper. Since many researchers have done many detailed and
   fruitful studies in security, the security solution illustrated in this
   paper is specific in the proposed architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The need for reliability, availability and performance has increased in
   modern applications, which need to handle rapidly growing demands while

   provide access to large pools of data and computational resources.
   Eucalyptus is a software framework used to implement private clouds and
   hybrid-style Infrastructure as a Service. It implements the API Amazon
   Web Service (AWS), allowing interoperability with other AWS-based
   services. Elastic block storage is a technology which provides flexible
   allocation of remote storage volumes to the virtual machines running in
   a cloud computing environment. This work investigates the software aging
   effects on the Eucalyptus framework, considering workloads composed of
   intensive requests for attaching remote storage volumes to virtual
   machines. The results evidenced problems that may be harmful to system
   dependability and its performance due to RAM memory exhaustion and
   subsequent use of swap memory, besides high CPU utilization by the
   virtual machines and subsequent increase in the response time of

Abstract = {{Most cloud computing service providers secure their offered cloud
   services by username/password schemes, which have been proven to be
   weak. While such schemes m ay be sufficient for simple personalized
   services, e-Government or e-Health applications in the cloud require
   more reliable and stronger mechanisms. One of such mechanisms are
   electronic IDs (eID), which allow for unique qualified identification
   and strong authentication. EIDs have been rolled-out in many EU Member
   States since years. In this paper we present how various national eIDs
   can be used for secure cloud authentication. We therefore extended the
   STORK eID interoperability framework, which will be the relevant
   identification and authentication framework across Europe in future.
   Furthermore, we increased usability by additionally applying single
   sign-on (SSO). Single sign-on defines the ability to authenticate just
   once in a distributed environment and gain access to several protected
   services. In fact, by our extended STORK architecture citizens of 18 EU
   Member States those Member States that support STORK - are able to use
   seamless authentication at different cloud service providers by using
   their own national eID.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach for the classification of the
   religious scriptures, the Hadith (sayings of Prophet Muhammad (plural
   Ahadith)). Muhadith is a distributed, Cloud based expert system that
   uses the Hadith science to classify Ahadith among 24 types from seven
   broad categories. Classification of the Hadith is a complex and
   sensitive task, and can only be performed by an expert of the Hadith
   sciences. Muhadith expert system is designed to imitate the Hadith
   experts for Hadith classification, and to enable a computer to behave
   like a Hadith expert to discriminate the authentic Ahadith from
   unauthentic ones. This paper presents the relationship and mapping of
   the expert system technology onto Hadith sciences, and technicalities
   involved in designing of the Muhadith expert system. We also propose
   solutions for the communicational and interoperability problems faced by
   the legacy web based distributed expert systems. We employ service
   oriented architecture to overcome the communicational problem and a
   candidature for the Software as a Service (SaaS) for the Cloud
   computing. The expert system also provides a reasoning facility that
   enables the user to look into the classification details. Muhadith
   expert system has been designed by merging the ideas from the domains of
   expert systems, Web technologies, and distributed computing systems.
   This type of an effort on the topic is rare and applying them in the
   domain of Hadith is our humble contribution.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a novel paradigm that enables
   software developers to create (develop or integrate), deploy, execute,
   and manage business applications, using a service provided by a third
   party. The diversity and heterogeneity of the existing PaaS offerings
   raises several interoperability challenges. The actual Platform as a
   Service market is still quite young, chaotic and highly fragmented,
   dominated by a few providers which use and promote incompatible
   standards and formats. This introduces adoption barriers due to the
   lock-in issues that prevent the portability of data and software from
   one PaaS to another. Moreover, software developers do not only need to
   deploy applications into a specific Cloud platform, but also to migrate
   applications from one Cloud platform to another, and to manage
   distributed applications spanning multiple PaaS. In this paper, we
   present a multi-cloud PaaS management as a result of the Cloud4SOA
   European project that addresses these challenges.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of Cloud Computing introduced new challenges in various
   computer science fields and disciplines, monitoring being one of them.
   Due to the multi-tenant nature of Cloud environment, its size and use of
   massive virtualization, the current monitoring solutions are approaching
   their limits. Unlike some other approaches, focusing on data
   integration, aggregation, and abstraction, our work focuses on a virtual
   machine representing the primary source of monitoring information. In
   this paper, we propose requirements for the producer of monitoring
   information addressing existing issues related to monitoring data
   representation, storage, processing and distribution. As a
   proof-of-concept, conforming to these requirements, prototype of
   event-based monitoring daemon is presented in detail. The resulting
   solution allows multiple users to consume monitoring information in an
   extensible data format without impairing interoperability.}},

   /Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS) and
   originally moderated by the United Nations Platform for Space-based
   Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER).
   The effort began by identifying and prototyping technologies which
   enabled the rapid gathering and dissemination of both space-based and
   ground sensor data and data products for the purpose of flood disaster
   management. This was followed by an international collaboration to build
   small portions of the identified system which was prototyped during the
   past few years during the flood seasons which occurred in the February
   through May timeframe of 2010 and 2011 with further prototyping to
   ongoing in 2012. The pilot effort has been fostered by CEOS to
   facilitate international efforts to promote satellite sensor data
   interoperability. In particular, the group has been making use of a
   technology effort call SensorWeb being developed at NASA which leverages
   Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards
   to facilitate various satellite and ground sensor interoperability. The
   group has made use of such satellites such as Earth Observing 1,
   Terra/Aqua MODIS and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Radarsat together
   with various ground sensors such as river gauges in Namibia and models
   such as Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) from Joint
   Research Center (JRC) from the European Commission. Finally, the group
   has been experimenting with integrating a large Cloud Computing service
   provided by the Open Cloud Consortium (OCC) with the SensorWeb to
   provide management and distribution of the large data sets for emergency

Abstract = {{These days, queues in hospitals grows due to, among others, the
   increasing of world population and delay in patient's attendance. One
   way of solving this problem is through the development of systems that
   ensure treatment directly in the house of patients. These systems help
   to decrease queues and improve attendance of those who goes to hospitals
   looking for assistance. In this paper we present the modeling of
   architecture for pervasive systems to homecare environments. Systems
   with this modeling aim to improve services provided by professionals
   during treatment of patients located in their houses. We used concepts
   of pervasive computing to provide access to information anytime and
   wherever the user is, once a homecare environment has a high level of
   dynamicity. The knowledge representation of the environment is done
   through ontologies due to the possibility of reuse of information
   stored, as well as the interoperability of information among different
   computational devices. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing is becoming increasingly established and offers several
   opportunities to obtain IT services in an on-demand manner. Especially
   infrastructure services, like storage and scalable computing resources,
   are gaining relevance and provide alternatives to conventional sourcing
   models. Despite the Cloud paradigm of flexible and limitless scalability
   the lack of standardization presents a big challenge in this context.
   Due to many providers, which are using different Cloud software
   including proprietary interfaces, the interoperability in the Cloud
   remains a theoretical construct. In this paper we examine
   standardization approaches within Cloud Computing and provide a
   comparison to practical implementations of interfaces of relevant Cloud
   software on the market. Finally, characteristics for a potential Cloud
   standard on the infrastructure level will be postulated.}},

Abstract = {{Current changes in the European electricity industry are driven by
   regulatory directives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, at the same
   time as replacing aged infrastructure and maintaining energy security.
   There is a wide acceptance of the requirement for smarter grids to
   support such changes and accommodate variable injections from renewable
   energy sources. However the design templates are still emerging to
   manage the level of information required to meet challenges such as
   balancing, planning and market dynamics under this new paradigm. While
   secure and scalable cloud computing architectures may contribute to
   supporting the informatics challenges of the smart grid, this paper
   focuses on the essential need for business alignment with standardised
   information models such as the IEC Common Information Model (CIM), to
   leverage data value and control system interoperability. In this paper
   we present details of use cases being considered by National Grid, the

Abstract = {{The vision of augmenting computing capabilities of mobile devices,
   especially smartphones with least cost is likely transforming to reality
   leveraging cloud computing. Cloud exploitation by mobile devices breeds
   a new research domain called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). However,
   issues like portability and interoperability should be addressed for
   mobile augmentation which is a non-trivial task using component-based
   approaches. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a promising design
   philosophy embraced by mobile computing and cloud computing communities
   to stimulate portable, complex application using prefabricated building
   blocks called Services. Utilizing distant cloud resources to host and
   run Services is hampered by long WAN latency. Exploiting mobile devices
   in vicinity alleviates long WAN latency, while creates new set of issues
   like Service publishing and discovery as well as client-server security,
   reliability, and Service availability. In this paper, we propose a
   market-oriented architecture based on SOA to stimulate publishing,
   discovering, and hosting Services on nearby mobiles, which reduces long
   WAN latency and creates a business opportunity that encourages mobile
   owners to embrace Service hosting. Group of mobile phones simulate a
   nearby cloud computing platform. We create new role of Service host by
   enabling unskilled mobile owners/users to host Services developed by
   skilled developers. Evidently, Service availability, reliability, and
   Service-oriented mobile application portability will increase towards
   green ubiquitous computing in our mobile cloud infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, in spite of concerns about the hype, cloud
   computing has expanded steadily both horizontally across industries, and
   vertically in organizations' technology stacks. Most technologies that
   enable cloud services existed prior to cloud computing's existence,
   although these days they rejuvenate, evolve and stimulate the
   computational ecosystem transformations. Actually the radical change for
   organizations is in rethinking and reengineering their traditional IT
   resources advancing them with cloud architectures and implementing
   services based on cloud computing delivery models. The change is
   underway on a large scale: from vendors and developers to providers and
   customers, and the key issues of ``cloudiness{''} are not only in
   economics and management, but in provisioning, interoperability and
   security of the integrated services.
   The Cloud Computing phenomenon likewise creates exciting challenges and
   opportunities for the entire educational system. For faculty, students,
   administration. and IT professionals it is a thrilling journey driven by
   many agendas cost cutting, delivering dynamic mobile and interactive
   computational services, utilizing and leveraging integrated IT

Abstract = {{Many organizations from the public and the private sector are planning
   to turn to Cloud Computing services, whose main benefits are
   flexibility, pay-per-use model and significant cost reduction. However,
   this new business paradigm for the provision of computing infrastructure
   has certain obstacles, including provider lock-in. When a client chooses
   a specific Cloud service provider, he also gets the provider's specific
   protocols, standards and tools, making a potential future migration
   complex and costly. Cloud Computing is still immature, with no firmly
   established standards governing all the aspects of its utilization. The
   migration issue can be overcome by using interoperable Cloud services.
   In this paper we focus on the platform as a service (PaaS) model of
   Cloud Computing. This model provides a complete computing platform
   needed to run applications over the Internet. Every PaaS provider (such
   as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce) has specified its custom
   application programming interfaces (APIs). However, to achieve
   interoperability we need to develop a standardized set of APIs that
   constitute an interoperability platform. In this paper, we firstly
   present the key concepts and relevant related work from the existing
   literature. Thereafter we propose a novel PaaS API ontology to share a
   common understanding of the main concepts from providers' APIs. We used
   a prominent ontology development methodology to determine the domain and
   scope of our ontology, review similar existing ontologies, define the
   relevant classes and their hierarchy as well as to define the properties
   of classes and create their instances. The concepts in our ontology were
   derived from PaaS resources, remote Cloud functions specified in the API
   documentation of the most important PaaS solutions, existing Cloud
   ontologies, Cloud Computing models and standards for Semantic Web
   services. The aim of the proposed ontology is the description of PaaS
   resources and their operations. It was built using the Web Ontology
   Language (OWL) and the Protege tool. In the future, we plan to use this
   ontology to semantically annotate PaaS API operations and create a
   mechanism to determine and solve interoperability problems among two or
   more PaaS services provided by different vendors.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on demand network
   access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be
   rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
   service provider interaction, using different deployment models, such as
   `software as a service' (SaaS), `platform as a service' (PaaS), and
   `infrastructure as a service' (IaaS), with public, private community,
   and hybrid clouds as deployment models. In general, cloud computing can
   be defined by considering its characteristic attributes, such as
   multi-tenancy, scalability, elasticity, pay as you go, and self
   provisioning of resources. Governments around the world are actively
   looking into cloud computing as a means of increasing efficiency and
   reducing cost. Apart from the potential benefits, such as increased
   flexibility, cost reduction, elastic scalability, and service quality
   that cloud computing could offer governments, different concerns, such
   as security, performance, availability, ability to customise, investment
   or regulatory requirements also have to be taken into consideration. In
   this study, first the cloud computing attributes that are needed for
   government use, such as governance, legal requirements, risk management,
   outsourcing, and security issues, and the requirements for eGovernment
   applications that are used in clouds were analysed, and second
   eGovernment use cases were analysed and categorised according to their
   fit to the cloud deployment models and then the GOV. Cloud Dashboard is
   introduced. The results of the study revealed that parameters, such as

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a buzz word that is also spilling over into the
   education industry, which enables access to software applications,
   hardware, data, and computer processing power on the Web, rather than
   installing software onto one's computer or server. For education, it
   offers new possibilities to structure and perform learning processes. In
   this study, the potential impact of cloud computing on education is
   analyzed, showing what it means for educators and students as well as
   institutions, and summarized under the heading `Generation C', where C
   stands for cloud. The results of the study revealed that cloud computing
   can be used by educators, institutions, and individual students as well
   as by jurisdiction to support particular teaching and learning
   experiences and to organize software availability. Challenges for
   educators and institutions using cloud computing in teaching could be
   summarized under the following keywords: interoperability and
   transferability, terms and conditions, security and privacy issues,
   backup and perpetuity, denial of service and content issues. On a whole,
   some implications of using cloud computing need to be kept in mind, good
   understanding of the applications in use, development of guidelines for
   use and migration strategies as well as the implementation of risk
   management could allow educators and institutions to take advantage of
   cloud computing, in turn offering rich online learning experiences for
   students.}},

Abstract = {{Web information systems are at a point where certain technologies and
   practices have reached a mature level of development and adoption by the
   industry. These information systems are widespread in institutions with
   different contexts and scopes, but in a global world, these systems have
   interoperation needs through standards that define ways to distribute
   high quality contents or services. On the other hand, there is an
   increasing number of new web technologies, tools and kinds of contents,
   devices and services that thrive outside the world of institutions.
   These have to be combined with new models of distributing, delivering
   and accessing services: Open Resources, Open Source Software and
   Creative Commons Licenses, and even the ``freemium{''} business models,
   which companies like Google, Layers, Prezzi or Twitter have adopted,
   presenting a deep impact on the panorama of Internet services. This
   special issue is devoted to the problem of how to integrate service
   based tools and contents, mobile applications and cloud computing
   services into the legacy systems. Systems that institutions have been
   implementing and putting to use with loss of effort and internal
   transformations; now realizing that their systems are limited, closed
   and far away from the crest of the wave of systems innovation. This is a
   problem whose solution seems to lie in the domain of Service Sciences,
   both from a technical point of view of SOA and interoperability
   standards, and from a point of view of business models, ways of
   collaboration inside software development teams and fair licensing
   strategies. This special issue includes experiences and perspectives
   organized in 9 papers.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing has evolved in a recent decade. It is the next upfront
   technology of Computer Science for providing online processing power and
   storage. Cloud Computing can be called a combination of remote and grid
   computing and is going to be the fifth utility beside water, gas,
   electricity, and telephony. So far different clouds are available, but
   they are private and are not interoperable with each other. On other
   side, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) technology which has already shown its
   metal in different fields like remote application handling, message
   transmission and the characteristics which make the agent technology
   different from ordinary software is that it is autonomous,
   self-organizing, adaptive and most important interoperable with each
   other as promised by FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agent).
   Therefore, MAS technology can be used for providing interoperability
   between clouds. In order to achieve the desired goal, it is strongly
   believed that adaptive transport protocol for an agents could be
   developed, subsequently, the same would be embedded in cloud computing
   for providing interoperability, portability, and outsourcing between or
   among clouds}},

Pages = {{153-172}},
Abstract = {{Over the last years, interoperability among resources has been emerged
   as one of the most challenging research topics. However, the commonality
   of the complexity of the architectures (e. g., heterogeneity) and the
   targets that each computational paradigm - including HPC, grids and
   clouds - aims to achieve (e. g., flexibility) remain the same. This is
   to efficiently orchestrate resources in a distributed computing fashion
   by bridging the gap among local and remote participants. Initially, this
   is closely related with the scheduling concept which is one of the most
   important issues for designing a cooperative resource management system,
   especially in large scale settings such as in grids and clouds. Within
   this context, meta-scheduling offers additional functionalities in the
   area of interoperable resource management, this is because of its great
   agility to handle sudden variations and dynamic situations in user
   demands. Accordingly, the case of inter-infrastructures, including
   InterCloud, entitle that the decentralised meta-scheduling scheme
   overcome issues like consolidated administration management, bottleneck
   and local information exposition. In this work, we detail the
   fundamental issues for developing an effective interoperable
   meta-scheduler for e-infrastructures in general and InterCloud in
   particular. Finally, we describe a simulation and experimental
   configuration based on real grid workload traces to demonstrate the
   interoperable setting as well as provide experimental results as part of
   a strategic plan for integrating future meta-schedulers.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing involves highly variable resource requirement that
   demands high availability, scalability and performance. At times, single
   cloud service provider would be saturated or running out of resources
   and may be unable to provide the services to its client, resulting in
   poor scalability and reliability. It may tarnish the trust parameter of
   customer. In addition, there is huge investment in setting up a single
   scalable cloud, which in turn has many environmental impacts. In this
   work, we propose an architecture to interconnect different clouds in P2P
   fashion to address the problems like efficiency bottleneck and single
   point of failure that are predominantly associated with traditional
   approaches. This idea gives access to much larger pools of
   resources/services. Each provider can maximize their profit by creating
   new collaborative services. These capabilities can be available and
   tradable through a service catalogue to support innovations and

Title = {{Progressive Data Transmission for Anatomical Landmark Detection in a
   Cloud}},
Journal = {{METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},

Pages = {{268-278}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the concept of cloud-computing-based systems, various
   authorized users have secure access to patient records from a number of
   care delivery organizations from any location. This creates a growing
   need for remote visualization, advanced image processing,
   state-of-the-art image analysis, and computer aided diagnosis.
   Objectives: This paper proposes a system of algorithms for automatic
   detection of anatomical landmarks in 3D volumes in the cloud computing
   environment. The system addresses the inherent problem of limited
   bandwidth between a (thin) client, data center, and data analysis
   server.
   Methods: The problem of limited bandwidth is solved by a hierarchical
   sequential detection algorithm that obtains data by progressively
   transmitting only image regions required for processing. The client
   sends a request to detect a set of landmarks for region visualization or
   further analysis. The algorithm running on the data analysis server
   obtains a coarse level image from the data center and generates landmark
   location candidates. The candidates are then used to obtain image
   neighborhood regions at a finer resolution level for further detection.
   This way, the landmark locations are hierarchically and sequentially
   detected and refined.
   Results: Only image regions surrounding landmark location candidates
   need to be trans- mitted during detection. Furthermore, the image
   regions are lossy compressed with JPEG 2000. Together, these properties
   amount to at least 30 times bandwidth reduction while achieving similar
   accuracy when compared to an algorithm using the original data.
   Conclusions: The hierarchical sequential algorithm with progressive data
   transmission considerably reduces bandwidth requirements in cloud-based
   detection systems.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years, the cloud computing technology has emerged as a
   new way to obtain computing resources on demand in a very dynamic
   fashion and only paying for what you consume. Nowadays, there are
   several hosting providers which follow this approach, offering resources
   with different capabilities, prices and SLAs. Therefore, depending on
   the users' preferences and the application requirements, a resource
   provider can fit better with them than another one. In this paper, we
   present an architecture for federating clouds, aggregating resources
   from different providers, deciding which resources and providers are the
   best for the users' interests, and coordinating the application
   deployment in the selected resources giving to the user the impression
   that a single cloud is used.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm that can abstract
   various computer resources and make the resources as services easily
   accessible to people. Meanwhile, cloud computing provides people with
   the resources in a pay-as-you-go style, i.e. charging for the use of
   resources. However, cloud computing cannot make people use everything in
   a cloud without caring about their own investments and resources. While
   cloud computing nowadays only cares about how to rent resources to
   people, people need a solution capable of combining their own resources
   and the rented resources to get the maximum benefit, i.e. the solution
   to customize a cloud according to people's needs.
   In this paper, the PROgram Ultra-Dispatcher (PROUD) is proposed for
   launching applications in a customization manner on cloud computing. The
   PROUD allows people to configure using their own computers or Virtual
   Machines (VMs) in clouds to run applications, no matter the applications
   are installed in people's computers or VMs in clouds. The PROUD allows
   people to regulate a rule for determining what computer or VM is capable
   of running the application according to available run-ime information
   such as CPU utilization, available memory, network activity, disk space
   or I/O activity, etc. Furthermore, the PROUD allows people to setup
   preference to affect the decision procedure of choosing a capable
   computer or VM. Functioning as a program loader in people's computers,
   the PROUD has high interoperability among VMs to work well without a
   limitation in using the same Cloud Service Provider's VMs. Because
   people usually rent parts of pay-as-you-go resources in clouds such as a
   couple of VMs, the PROUD is justified to be a solution capable of
   combining their own resources and the rented resources to get the
   maximum benefit. Currently, the PROUD is implemented on Windows XP with
   a script file written in a portable language, so the PROUD has high
   portability among Windows platforms and high acceptability to people who
   are familiar with Windows platforms. The PROUD is given experiments in
   this paper to identify its practicability, overhead, and performance.

Abstract = {{The speech will describe the recent evolutionary paths of European
   research about Enterprise Interoperability. In 2006, the Enterprise
   Interoperability cluster of European projects coined the term ISU
   (Interoperability Service Utility) as the new IT infrastructure able to
   provide interoperability services to all SMEs, at low cost and under
   non-rivalry and non-discriminatory principles. This concept has been
   studied and developed further by the COIN flagship Integrated Project
   (COllaboration and INteroperability for networked enterprises),
   coordinated by TXT e-solutions, which started in 2008 and developed a
   first prototype of ISU by means of a dynamic federation of open and
   trusted Generic Service Delivery Platforms as well as envisaging a set
   of innovative business models for Enterprise Interoperability as a
   Service-Utility. More recently, the advent of EU 2020 Strategy and
   Digital Agenda for Europe confirmed the importance of having
   ``interoperability and standards{''} as one of the most important
   pillars for a single digital market for European citizens and
   enterprises. This evident commoditization trend could induce readers to
   think that in 10 years time interoperability will not matter anymore (N.
   Carr ``IT does not matter{''}) and that it will soon be absorbed by
   Cloud Computing and Future Internet as one of the fundamental services
   of a so-called Universal Business System. However, more and more eminent
   scientists tend now to agree that it is when a technology really becomes
   a utility and apparently does not matter anymore (Z. Turk calls it
   sedimentation) that innovation could find the most fertile and promising
   ground to develop and grow. Based on the sound and solid base of Future
   Internet core platform and enterprise interoperability utility
   infrastructure, a new project, MSEE (Manufacturing SErvice Ecosystem),
   coordinated by TXT and started in October 2011, is now trying to explore
   how the commoditization and openness of IT could become an enabler for
   service innovation in the manufacturing industry, allowing virtual
   factories and enterprises to adopt a value co-creation and service
   dominant logic instead of a traditional perspective of producing and
   selling just physical goods. It is thanks to Enterprise Modelling and
   Interoperability as an integrated part of a Universal Business System
   that a milling machine industry could sell ``holes per minute{''} or
   that an aircraft engine industry could sell ``flying hours{''} or that a
   traditional car manufacturer could sell ``mobility kilometers{''}. As a
   future perspective, the speech will also address the key question
   whether technical-service-business innovation, implemented for instance
   by the Factories of the Future and the MSEE project, could be sufficient
   for European manufacturing industry to overcome the current economic
   crisis or, instead, a re-thinking of skills and competencies of
   employees is needed in order to implement and take up the changes
   imposed by innovation. In this perspective, a new research initiative,
   coordinated by TXT and called TELL ME (Technology Enhanced Learning
   Livinglab for Manufacturing Environments), is going to be launched in
   November 2012 with the aim of implementing human-centric manufacturing
   and innovative methods and solutions for blue collar workers lifelong
   training, via open innovation and participative creativity Living Labs.}},

   managed clusters. On the other side, such ability, has opened new
   challenges for the execution of their computational work and the
   managing of massive amounts of data into resources provided by different
   private and public infrastructures.
   COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a programming framework that provides a
   programming model and a runtime that ease the development of
   applications for distributed environments and their execution on a wide
   range of computational infrastructures. COMPSs has been recently
   extended in order to be interoperable with several cloud technologies
   like Amazon, OpenNebula, Emotive and other OCCI compliant offerings.
   This paper presents the extensions of this interoperability layer to
   support the execution of COMPSs applications into the Windows Azure
   Platform. The framework has been evaluated through the porting of a data
   mining workflow to COMPSs and the execution on an hybrid testbed.}},

Abstract = {{In modern healthcare environments, healthcare providers are more willing
   to shift their electronic medical record systems to clouds. Instead of
   building and maintaining dedicated data centers, this paradigm enables
   to achieve lower operational cost and better interoperability with other
   healthcare providers. However, the adoption of cloud computing in
   healthcare systems may also raise many security challenges associated
   with authentication, identity management, access control, trust
   management, and so on. In this paper, we focus on access control issues
   in electronic medical record systems in clouds. We propose a systematic
   access control mechanism to support selective sharing of composite
   electronic health records (EHRs) aggregated from various health care
   providers in clouds. Our approach ensures that privacy concerns are
   accommodated for processing access requests to patients' healthcare
   information. We also demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our
   approach by implementing a proof-of-concept prototype along with
   evaluation results.}},

Abstract = {{It is extremely important for the healthcare domain to have a
   standardized communication because will improve the quality of
   information and in the end the resulting benefits will improve the
   quality of patients' life. The standards proposed to be used are: HL7
   CDA and CCD. For a better access to the medical data a solution based on
   cloud computing (CC) is investigated. CC is a technology that supports
   flexibility, seamless care, and reduced costs of the medical act. To
   ensure interoperability between healthcare information systems a
   solution creating a Web Custom Control is presented. The control shows
   the database tables and fields used to configure the two standards. This
   control will facilitate the work of the medical staff and hospital
   administrators, because they can configure the local system easily and
   prepare it for communication with other systems. The resulted
   information will have a higher quality and will provide knowledge that
   will support better patient management and diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing technology has reached a good level of maturity. The
   market of cloud resources is still dominated by proprietary solutions
   for what concerns resource delivering, pricing models and Service Level
   Agreement. The research community is working hard to define
   specifications that try to standardize most of these aspects. When
   standards will get mature, customers will no more be locked-up to any
   proprietary technology, and full interoperability among clouds will be a
   reality. In the future cloud resource market the competition challenge
   will be played on the real capability of providers to accommodate
   customers' requests in a flexible way and to supply high and
   differentiated QoS levels. In this scenario a mechanism must be devised
   to support the matchmaking between what providers offer and what
   customers' applications demand. In this work we propose the definition
   of a semantic model to support the supply-demand matchmaking process in
   the future cloud markets. Leveraging on a semantic description of the
   cloud resources' features, customers will be able to discover cloud
   offers that best suit their own business needs. Tests conducted on an
   implementation prototype proved the viability of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of common standards in a fast emerging Cloud computing market
   over the last years resulted in ``vendor lock in{''} and
   interoperability issues across heterogeneous Cloud platforms. Therefore,
   the Cloud user is facing now a challenging problem of selecting the
   Cloud provider that fits his needs. A new promising research approach is
   the use of intermediate broker services to assist the user in finding
   the appropriate Cloud resources that satisfy his requirements. In this
   paper, we present a generic simulation framework based on the CloudSim
   toolkit for the validation and evaluation of a Cloud service broker
   deployed on an Intercloud environment. A unique feature of the framework
   is the integration of several state of the art technologies and
   standards, which makes it easy to deploy on real production Clouds.
   After presenting the framework fundamental architecture, we discuss in
   detail the solved implementation challenges. Finally, we present some
   initial evaluation results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an on-going research to develop the Inter-Cloud
   Architecture, which addresses the architectural problems in
   multi-provider multi-domain heterogeneous cloud based applications
   integration and interoperability, including integration and
   interoperability with legacy infrastructure services. Cloud technologies
   are evolving into a common way to virtualize infrastructure services and
   to offer on-demand service provisioning. In this way, they add
   physical/hardware platform independency and mobility to the existing
   distributed computing and networking technologies. The paper uses
   existing standards in Cloud Computing, in particular the recently
   published NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (CCRA) as the
   basis for the Inter-Cloud architecture. The proposed Inter-Cloud
   Architecture defines three complimentary components addressing
   Inter-Cloud interoperability and integration: multilayer Cloud Services
   Model that combines commonly adopted cloud service models, such as IaaS,
   PaaS, SaaS, in one multilayer model with corresponding inter-layer
   interfaces; Inter-Cloud Control and Management Plane that supports cloud
   based applications interaction; and Inter-Cloud Federation Framework.
   The paper briefly presents the architectural framework for cloud based
   infrastructure services provisioning being developed by the authors. The
   proposed architecture intends to provide a basis for building multilayer
   cloud services integration framework and to allow optimised provisioning
   of computing, storage and networking resources. In this way, the
   proposed Inter-Cloud architecture will facilitate cloud interoperability
   and integration.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating a database query language into a programming language is
   becoming increasingly important in recently emerging high-level cloud
   computing and other applications, where efficient and sophisticated data
   manipulation is required during computation. This paper reports on
   seamless integration of SQL into SML\# - an extension of Standard ML. In
   the integrated language, the type system always infers a principal type
   for any type consistent SQL expression. This makes SQL queries
   first-class citizens, which can be freely combined with any other
   language constructs definable in Standard ML. For a program involving
   SQL queries, the compiler separates SQL queries and delegates their
   evaluation to a database server, e. g. PostgreSQL or MySQL in the
   currently implemented version.
   The type system of our language is largely based on Machiavelli, which
   demonstrates that ML with record polymorphism can represent type
   structure of SQL. In order to develop a practical language, however, a
   number of technical challenges have to be overcome, including static
   enforcement of server connection consistency, proper treatment of
   overloaded SQL primitives, query compilation, and runtime connection
   management. This paper describes the necessary extensions to the type
   system and compilation, and reports on the details of its
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure federation is becoming an increasingly important issue
   for modern Distributed Computing Infrastructures (DCIs): Dynamic
   elasticity of quasi-static Grid environments, incorporation of
   special-purpose resources into commoditized Cloud infrastructures,
   cross-community collaboration for increasingly diverging areas of modern
   e-Science, and Cloud Bursting pose major challenges on the technical
   level for many resource and middleware providers. Especially with
   respect to increasing costs of operating data centers, the intelligent
   yet automated and secure sharing of resources is a key factor for
   success. With the D-Grid Scheduler Interoperability (DGSI) project
   within the German D-Grid Initiative, we provide a strategic technology
   for the automatically negotiated, SLA-secured, dynamically provisioned
   federation of resources and services for Grid-and Cloud-type
   infrastructures. This goal is achieved by complementing current DCI
   schedulers with the ability to federate infrastructure for the temporary
   leasing of resources and rechanneling of workloads. In this work, we
   describe the overall architecture and SLA-secured negotiation protocols
   within DGSI and depict an advanced mechanism for resource delegation
   through means of dynamically provisioned, virtualized middleware.
   Through this methodology, we provide the technological foundation for
   intelligent capacity planning and workload management in a
   cross-infrastructure fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Grid Application Repositories vary greatly in terms of access interface,
   security system, implementation technology, communication protocols and
   repository model. This diversity has become a significant limitation in
   terms of interoperability and inter-repository access. This paper
   presents the Grid Application Meta-Repository System (GAMRS) as a
   solution that offers better options for the management of Grid
   applications. GAMRS proposes a generic repository architecture, which
   allows any Grid Application Repository (GAR) to be connected to the
   system independent of their underlying technology. It also presents
   applications in a uniform manner and makes applications from all
   connected repositories visible to web search engines, OGSI/WSRF Grid
   Services and other OAI (Open Archive Initiative)-compliant repositories.
   GAMRS can also function as a repository in its own right and can store
   applications under a new repository model. With the help of this model,
   applications can be presented as embedded in virtual machines (VM) and
   therefore they can be run in their native environments and can easily be
   deployed on virtualized infrastructures allowing interoperability with
   new generation technologies such as cloud computing,
   application-on-demand, automatic service/application deployments and
   automatic VM generation.}},

Abstract = {{In the European context, Italian legislation bodies have intervened on
   several occasions and time and time again through regulatory
   interventions aimed at regulating the use of ICT both in the Public
   Administration and the private sector. The aim of this work is to
   ascertain why the most advanced regulations and most widespread
   technologies alone cannot manage to bridge the current and verifiable
   gap between Public Administration and Information Communication
   Technologies. We will firstly address the evolution of the legislation
   and make particular reference to the Italian situation as well as
   analyse the European funding programmes for implementing ICT in the PA
   and we will then study the factors preventing ICT's real, successful
   penetration in the public structure and the role of digital culture. For
   the authors, the lack of an adequate digital culture for both old and
   new generations of digital citizens is the real reason for the current
   gap between ICT and the PA. Young citizens - Strength: they are included
   within the definition of digital natives. Using technologies to
   communicate-exchange-share comes naturally to them. Weakness: they lack
   adequate digital education to get the most out of the tools at their
   disposal. Result: complete immaturity in the knowledge of their own
   rights and especially their own duties. The old generation of digital
   citizens - Strength: population of seniors who are fundamentally curious
   and conscious of ICT news, especially in relation to the PA; confident
   in a support essential to simplifying their existence. Weakness: a)
   distrust often born of false information about new ICT tools for their
   benefit; b) incompatibility and incommunicability between information
   systems from various Public Administrations; c) citizen interoperability
   procedures/PA sometimes still too confusing or unclear and characterised
   by haphazard development, with areas (and offices and/or local
   administrations) that are extremely developed alternated with areas that
   have remained behind. During this analysis we cannot forget the concept
   of broadband internet access as synonymous with fast access to the
   network. The possibility of use facilitated by a 2.0 internet structure
   for the citizen. Broadband internet access as a citizen's right.
   European and national overview. The difference between the idea of
   broadband internet access as a citizen's right in Italy and other
   European countries will also be explored: in Switzerland (in 2008), in
   Finland (in 2010, each of the approximately 5 million Finns will have
   the right to a minimum speed connection of 1Mbps and broadband,
   currently in a transitional period, that should reach 100 Mbps by 2015);
   in Spain (in 2011). In Italy: Professor Rodota recently spoke of this,
   in an intentionally defiant tone, so as to unofficially push for a
   solution to the problem. In fact, our legal system already guarantees
   the right to Internet in article 3 of the Italian Constitution. In
   conclusion, the characteristics of service providers will be examined as
   well the reasons for not having an open standardisation for internet
   access as yet another phenomenon to negatively influence the ICT and
   Public Administration relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Current cloud-based service offerings are often provided as
   one-size-fits-all solutions and give little or no room for
   customization. This limits the ability for application developers to
   pick and choose offerings from multiple software, platform,
   infrastructure service providers and configure them dynamically and in
   an optimal fashion to address their application requirements.
   Furthermore, combining different independent cloud-based services
   necessitates a uniform description format that facilitates their design,
   customization, and composition. Hence, there is a need to break down the
   monolithic offerings into loosely-coupled cloud services offered by
   multiple providers that can be flexibly customized and (re-)composed in
   different settings. We propose in this paper the Blueprint concept - a
   uniform abstract description for cloud service offerings that may cross
   different cloud computing layers, i.e. software, platform and
   infrastructure. Using the proposed Blueprint Template for engineering
   cloud service offerings will solve these shortcomings and subsequently
   lower the barrier to entry for cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing, a more recent computing paradigm, has evolved from a
   variety of legacy technologies that include Service oriented
   Architecture (SOA) and Web services besides several others. The software
   services in a cloud must be developed based on the service-oriented
   approach, in order to derive their full potential and benefits. Since.
   SOA inherently nurtures interoperability; it will enhance the
   integration and interaction among the cloud software services. Also,
   leveraging the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach to develop
   individual cloud software services will result in services that are more
   robust, flexible and agile in the wake of ever changing technologies.
   This paper is an attempt by the authors to lay emphasis on the
   convergence of Cloud computing, SOA and MDA in development of optimum
   business solutions.}},

Abstract = {{In today's highly dynamic economy, businesses have to adapt quickly to
   market changes, be it customer, competition- or regulation-driven. Cloud
   computing promises to be a solution to the ever changing computing
   demand of businesses. Current SaaS, PaaS and IaaS services are often
   found to be too inflexible to meet the diverse customer requirements
   regarding service composition and Quality-of-Service. We therefore
   propose an ontology-based optimization framework allowing Cloud
   providers to find the best suiting resource composition based on an
   abstract request for a custom service. Our contribution is three-fold.
   First, we describe an OWL/SWRL based ontology framework for describing
   resources (hard- and software) along with their dependencies,
   interoperability constraints and meta information. Second, we provide an
   algorithm that makes use of some reasoning queries to derive a graph
   over all feasible resource compositions based on the abstract request.
   Third, we show how the graph can be transformed into an integer program,
   allowing to find the optimal solution from a profit maximizing
   perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a sufficiently new research area. Since it is in its
   development stages, the information on the field is slowly being
   compiled by the researchers and practitioners from their experiences.
   Some of the areas in which there is still a gap on reporting on legal,
   privacy, security, access and regulatory issues. This paper raises an
   awareness of legal, privacy, security, access and regulatory issues that
   are associated with the advent of cloud computing. An in-depth
   literature survey is conducted on these and an analysis is drawn from
   the issues that are identified through the literature survey.
   Recommendations are then given on how the issues identified in the
   analysis can be mitigated. These recommendations centre around the
   issues of policy interventions, standards, privacy and data protection,
   traffic and congestion management, business continuity planning,
   security and regulation. This research is an advancement of knowledge in
   that field and is meant to initiate further debate on cloud computing}},

Abstract = {{Integrating a database query language into a programming language is
   becoming increasingly important in recently emerging high-level cloud
   computing and other applications, where efficient and sophisticated data
   manipulation is required during computation. This paper reports on
   seamless integration of SQL into SML\# - an extension of Standard ML. In
   the integrated language, the type system always infers a principal type
   for any type consistent SQL expression. This makes SQL queries
   first-class citizens, which can be freely combined with any other
   language constructs definable in Standard ML. For a program involving
   SQL queries, the compiler separates SQL queries and delegates their
   evaluation to a database server, e.g. PostgreSQL or MySQL in the
   currently implemented version.
   The type system of our language is largely based on Machiavelli, which
   demonstrates that ML with record polymorphism can represent type
   structure of SQL. In order to develop a practical language, however, a
   number of technical challenges have to be overcome, including static
   enforcement of server connection consistency, proper treatment of
   overloaded SQL primitives, query compilation, and runtime connection
   management. This paper describes the necessary extensions to the type
   system and compilation, and reports on the details of its
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of medical images has increased significantly over the last
   decade as result of the increase of number and quality of studies.
   Following some researchers, this trend will continue over the next
   years. Cloud computing is a new concept based on a well-know model named
   ``pay-as-you-go{''}. There is a new concept dubbed PACS Cloud, which the
   fundamental idea is to do PACS outsourcing taking advantages of the
   clouds elasticity and scalability, avoiding hardware obsolescence,
   providing universal access to the information anywhere, anytime and
   increase the data availability. This paper presents a module of PACS
   Cloud architecture to grant interoperability with DICOM devices. PACS
   Cloud Gateway is a component of PACS Cloud, which focuses mainly on the
   translation from DICOM commands to non-DICOM and vice-versa. While data
   outsource to the cloud can relieve users from the burden of local
   storage and maintenance, it also brings new security concerns. This
   paper presents a secure PACS Cloud Gateway to access PACS Cloud archive,
   which provides a high security level and without cloud's provider
   dependence. The workflows of each process was described carefully,
   specifying data flows since that Gateway is contacted by DICOM device,
   until it releases the process. Finally, the platform was instantiated In
   biggest Internet Cloud providers and the solution's results was
   analysed.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing introduces a novel computing paradigm that provisions
   on-demand computational capacity as a service. Increasing numbers of
   users are migrating their applications to the computing Clouds to remove

   individual Cloud platforms, either private or public, provide their own
   interfaces for customers to interact with the underlying
   infrastructures. This situation undoubtedly burdens the users who
   compute on different Clouds. In this work, we developed a generic
   interface that allows the user to access the diverse Clouds in a unified
   way. It provides utilities for requesting and invoking the services. It
   offers graphical views to show the Cloud information that is visible to
   the users. The interface also combines different Clouds into a single
   platform enabling inter-Cloud communications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper highlights the importance of the interoperability of the
   encrypted DB in terms of the characteristics of DB and efficient
   schemes. Although most prior researches have developed efficient
   algorithms under the provable security, they do not focus on the
   interoperability of the encrypted DB. In order to address this lack of
   practical aspects, we conduct two practical approaches-efficiency and
   group search in cloud datacenter. The process of this paper is as
   follows: first, we create two schemes of efficiency and group
   search-practical keyword index search-I and II; second, we define and
   analyze group search secrecy and keyword index search privacy in our
   schemes; third, we experiment on efficient performances over our
   proposed encrypted DB. As the result, we summarize two major results:
   (1) our proposed schemes can support a secure group search without
   re-encrypting all documents under the group-key update and (2) our
   experiments represent that our scheme is approximately 935 times faster
   than Golle's scheme and about 16 times faster than Song's scheme for
   10,000 documents. Based on our experiments and results, this paper has
   the following contributions: (1) in the current cloud computing
   environments, our schemes provide practical, realistic, and secure
   solutions over the encrypted DB and (2) this paper identifies the
   importance of interoperability with database management system for
   designing efficient schemes.}},

Abstract = {{After receiving cancer treatment, patients often experience a decline of
   HRQoL (health-related quality of life). Physicians typically evaluate
   HRQoL during periodic clinical visits. However, out-patient reporting of
   vital signals between two visits could be used to interpret the decline
   of HRQoL. Considering that the vast majority of patients recovering from
   cancer are not in hospitals, it is often impractical for the care
   providers to collect these data. In this paper, we design and prototype
   caREMOTE, a cancer reporting and monitoring telemedicine system, which
   can be used in domestic cancer care. By extending a standard clinical
   trial informatics model, we build a prototype on cloud computing
   services that can be accessed by a mobile application. We aim to
   maximize the potential of caREMOTE to help medical practitioners
   efficiently monitor discharged patients' HRQoL and vital signals, and
   facilitate data reusability and system interoperability in future
   collaborative cancer research.}},

   satisfy security requirements through techniques like fragmentation and
   provides new prospects in terms of legal aspects. Based on this concept,
   we discuss a reference architecture that enables new service models by
   horizontal and vertical integration. The definition along with the
   reference architecture serves as a common vocabulary for discussions and
   suggests a template for creating value-added software solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing can be defined as accessing and utilizing third party
   software, services and resources and paying as per usage. It facilitates
   scalability and virtualized resources over the Internet as a service;
   providing cost effective and scalable solution to customers. There are
   two emerging methodologies for constructing infrastructure:
   ``Cloudcenters{''} and ``Infrastructure Web Services{''}. Cloudcenters
   can be regarded as a virtualized data center. Infrastructure Web
   Services are more analogous to Service-Oriented-Architectures (SOA),
   require significant programming skills and are much more comfortable for
   software developers. It is a robust ecosystem of services which you can
   use in order to build your application, getting the traditional benefits
   of Cloud Computing such as self-service, pay-as-you-go, and massive
   scalability. Unfortunately, talking about openness and interoperability
   in cloud computing, cloud providers still operate very much in their own
   silos and private-cloud APIs drift further and further apart. Most data
   center vendors do not offer users complete vertically integrated cloud
   stacks. However, they are often providing solutions which imply a strong
   vendor lock-in. A lot of activities are currently aimed at the
   development of various Cloud computing environments and software
   engineering practices for the management of distributed applications,
   services and other resources. We are thinking about a future vision of a
   network of clouds. It should be an open market for components
   (applications, services, data sources, etc.) and composed ecosystem
   infrastructure services that facilitate appropriate collaboration for
   personalized needs. In this paper we would like to slightly modify the
   original cloud stack towards the development of an open environment for
   task-oriented personalized cloud ecosystems and apply a resource
   integration platform for this ecosystem elaboration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study about information sharing and domain
   ontological modeling within the framework of cloud computing services.
   We have investigated common practices on service oriented architectures
   design and knowledge engineering to support the composition of services
   in the cloud. Research results about information sharing and information
   modeling by using semantic annotations are discussed. Particularly we
   present how we use ontological models to represent management
   information and service lifecycle operations and thus control both
   system management operations and services running onto cloud
   infrastructure. We support the idea of look information sharing as a
   mechanism to facilitate the composition of services, thus ontology-based
   information modelling is used for this purpose. It enables information
   exchange by using interoperable data framework for different
   applications running on infrastructure and application layers.
   Ontologies support this information sharing approach by formalizing the
   necessary data needs to be shared or exchanged. An introductory
   application scenario is depicted. We discuss what implications this
   approach imposes on architectural design terms and also how virtual
   infrastructures and cloud-based systems can benefit from this
   ontological modelling approach.}},

Abstract = {{User-generated content (UGC) has become one of the dominant media
   formats. However, current approach to distribute UGC adds two middlemen
   (e.g., content aggregator and content distributor) in the value chain,
   resulting in a higher cost for media consumers. We have proposed a new
   model for content providers to request content-distribution-as-a-service
   (CoDaaS) in an on-demand fashion from service providers, thus bypassing
   the middlemen and reducing the total cost of content distribution. In
   this paper, we extend the concept of CoDaaS over different flavors of
   future Internet architecture. One challenge to provide such an emerging
   service over different Internet architecture is to design an inter-cloud
   messaging protocol to provide interoperability among all participant
   network clouds. To tackle this challenge, we structure the inter-cloud
   messaging protocol into three components including message vehicle,
   message format and message content. In particular, we highlight a few
   options for message vehicle and formats and offer our initial choice
   with rationale; we also categorize message contents into six
   sub-domains. This structural approach would make our work toward a
   proof-of-concept system easier.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing holds great promise for addressing the barriers that
   keep people with disabilities, low literacy and aging-related
   impairments from fully engaging with technology. However, using
   cloud-based computing to make assistive technology (AT) more widely
   available also raises legal and policy issues. The Americans with
   Disabilities Act, United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons
   with Disabilities, Communications Act, and other disability rights laws
   support increased availability of AT. However, what should the balance
   be between built-in accessibility and cloud-based access? There are also
   limits to the requirements and coverage of these laws, and issues about
   the definition of accessibility as technology develops. Copyright and
   digital rights are potentially implicated by cloud-based AT, as well as
   privacy and security rights. The needed infrastructure and
   interoperability of cloud-based AT may raise concerns for technology
   developers that regulation may stifle innovation or reduce commercial
   viability.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing as a service on demand architecture has become a, topic
   of interest in the last few years. The outsourcing of duties and
   infrastructure to external parties enables new services to be
   established quickly, scaled on demand, and with low financial risk.
   Cloud storage enables organizations to manage their data with low
   operational expenses. Nevertheless, several issues such as security and
   the risk to become dependent on a provider for its service should be
   considered before entering the cloud. In general, a switch of a storage
   provider is associated with high costs of adapting new APIs and
   additional charges for inbound and outbound bandwidth and requests. In
   this paper we use the principle of RAID-technology in cloud
   infrastructure to manage data distribution across cloud storage
   providers. The distribution is based on users expectations regarding
   providers geographic location, quality of service, providers reputation,
   and budget preferences. Our approach allows users to avoid vendor
   lock-in, reduce cost of switching providers and increase security and
   availability of their data. We also explain on how the proposed system
   removes the complexity of interacting with multiple storage providers
   while maintaining security.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, interoperability and scalability are two major challenging
   issues for cloud computing. Forming a dynamic collaboration (DC)
   platform among cloud providers (CPs) can help to better address these
   issues. A DC platform can facilitate expense reduction, avoiding adverse
   business impacts and offering collaborative or portable cloud services
   to consumers. However, there are two major challenges involved in this
   undertaking; one is to find an appropriate market model to enable a DC
   platform, and the other one is to minimize conflicts among CPs that may
   occur in a market-oriented DC platform. In this paper, we present a
   novel combinatorial auction (CA)-based cloud market (CACM) model that
   enables a DC platform in CPs. To minimize conflicts among CPs, a new
   auction policy is proposed that allows a CP to dynamically collaborate
   with suitable partner CPs to form groups and publishes their group bids
   as a single bid to compete in the auction. However, identifying a
   suitable combination of CP partners to form the group and reduce
   conflicts is a NP-hard problem. Hence, we propose a promising
   multi-objective (MO) optimization model for partner selection using
   individual information and past collaborative relationship information,
   which is seldom considered. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA)
   called MOGA-IC is proposed to solve the MO optimization problem. This
   algorithm is developed using two popular MOGAs, the non-dominated
   sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and the strength pareto evolutionary
   genetic algorithm (SPEA2). The experimental results show that MOGA-IC
   with NSGA-II outperformed the MOGA-IC with SPEA2 in identifying useful
   pareto-optimal solution sets. Other simulation experiments were
   conducted to verify the effectiveness of the MOGA-IC in terms of
   satisfactory partner selection and conflict minimization in the CACM
   model. In addition, the performance of the CACM model was compared to
   the existing CA model in terms of economic efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The need, use, benefit and potential of e-portfolios have been analysed
   and discussed by a substantial body of researchers in the education
   community. However, the development and implementation approaches of
   e-portfolios to date have faced with various challenges and limitations.
   This paper presents a new approach of an e-portfolio system design based
   on Private-Public (PrPl) data index system, which integrates cloud
   computing applications and storages with Semantic Web architecture,
   making semantic web-based visualisation and advanced intelligent search
   possible. It also discusses how the distinctive attributes of the
   PrPl-based digital asset management system can serve as a large-scale
   robust e-portfolio system that can address issues with scalability,
   sustainability, adoptability and interoperability. With such a new
   distinctive design, a large-scale deployment at a state or national
   level becomes possible at a very cost-effective manner and also such
   large-scale deployment with intelligent digital asset management and
   search features create numerous opportunities in education.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic refinement of stakeholders' requirements is a fundamental issue
   in requirements engineering Facing with the on-demand collaboration
   problem among the heterogeneous, autonomous, and dynamic service
   resources in the Web, service requirements refinement becomes extremely

   semantic interoperability aggregation A method for creating connecting

   connecting ontologies, a method for semantic interoperability
   aggregation in requirements refinement is proposed In addition, we
   discover that the necessary condition for semantic interoperability is
   semantic similarity, and the sufficient condition is the coverability of
   the agreed mediation ontology Based on this viewpoint, a metric
   framework for calculating semantic interoperability capability is
   proposed This methodology can provide a semantic representation
   mechanism for refining users' requirements, meanwhile, since users'
   requirements in the Web usually originate from different domains, it can
   also provide semantic interoperability guidance for networked service
   discovery, and is an effective approach for the realization of on-demand

   that can offer in a unique way the functionalities needed for the
   adoption of BIM, is essential. The implementation of BIM under the Cloud
   Computing paradigm holds the promise of accelerating the B\&C industry
   to achieve the Single Electronic Market. After presenting the vision for
   a Single European Electronic Market, and the expectation of the B\&C
   sector to be integrated in a universal information space, this paper
   proposes the SOA4BIM framework as a cloud of services that enables
   universal access to the BIM paradigm by any system, application, or end
   user on the web. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of cloud computing, the mutual understandability
   among distributed Access Control Policies (ACPs) and attribute of
   entities has become an important issue in the security field of open
   distributed environment. Semantic Web technology provides the solution
   to semantic interoperability of heterogeneous applications. In this
   paper, we analysis existing access control approaches and present a new
   Semantics Based Cross Domain Access Control Approach with Semantic
   Access Control Policy Language (SACPL) for describing ACPs. Semantic
   access control architecture is designed to embed SACPL language and
   Access Control Oriented Ontology System (ACOOS) into the access control
   process. Using the approach presented, access control across different
   domains can be effectively solved through the description and management
   of semantic attribute. This study enriches the research that the
   semantic web technology is applied in the field of security, and
   provides a new way of thinking of access control in cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of hardware assisted virtualization and the broadband
   Internet have taken the Information Technology (IT) hosted managed
   services to a next level of evolution, where the software applications
   have become independent of the hardware infrastructure and can be
   migrated at will. This introduces two key issues that need to be
   addressed to fully leverage the potential that the new servers and
   virtualization offer:
   1. The operation and management of virtual services have to be decoupled
   from the operation and management of the server, network and storage
   physical infrastructure that hosts them
   2. Resource provisioning must be application sensitive, dynamic to meet
   the transient nature of services that can migrate and must accommodate
   latency constraints of services that utilize them.

   Computing under the aegis of 19th IEEE International Workshops on

Abstract = {{Correctional Service Canada (CSC) operates 57 Institutions equipped with
   a range of mission critical Security, Communications and Access
   Management systems. These include CCTV assessment, intrusion detection,
   radio communications and door control systems. User Interfaces range
   from colour graphic touch screens to knobs, push buttons etc.
   Operational and technical challenges include the following issues:
   -sub-system technology is vendor specific,
   -reliability is critical in a challenging environment,
   -system maintenance is expensive, -inconsistent `` Look and Feel{''}
   resulting in usability issues,
   -costly to add new systems, multiple, legacy and proprietary protocols
   \& connectivity approaches, legacy installations are cable intensive,
   -minimal operator or maintenance training crossover,
   -procurement requirements drive `` silo{''} system implementation.
   The objective is to develop a `` next generation{''} systems
   architecture that will: `` abstract{''} the subsystem user management
   interfaces, ensuring all sub-systems can be managed using a simple,
   consistent graphical user interface, accessible using a web browser;
   model the data and behaviour of the edge devices, doors; cameras,
   sensors, etc. and normalizes it; allowing them to be managed by and
   provide notifications to standard software based applications; support
   inter-domain interoperability; use an industry standard communications
   protocol, likely with extensions, such as BACNet or SNMP, for edge
   device to application server connectivity; use TCP/ IP over fibre as the
   preferred transport, network and physical technologies; integrate legacy
   sub-systems into the application server using mediation software; define
   the look and feel of the graphical icons that represent the edge devices
   and the physical environment in which they are placed, so that each
   domain is presented in a consistent manner. Developing and adopting this
   architecture will allow Correctional Service Canada to address the
   challenges of its unique environment and support the definition,
   procurement and deployment of subsystems more effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is the emerging technology in distributed, autonomic,
   service-oriented, on-demand, trusted computing. The fact that several
   Cloud solutions have been implemented so far, such as Amazon EC2 and
   S-3, IBM's Blue Cloud, Sun Network.com, Microsoft Azure Services
   Platform, etc., is evidence of the great success already achieved by
   this computing paradigm. On the other hand, an increasing number of
   research projects focus on Cloud (Nimbus, OpenNEbula, Eucalyptus,
   OpenQRM, RESERVOIR, etc.) thus confirming that the topic is really hot,
   attracts investments and funds, and involves more and more researchers.
   Our idea of Cloud has been synthesized into Cloud@Home, a computing
   paradigm that supports both open and commercial communities. Starting
   from the contribution philosophy at the basis of the Volunteer computing
   paradigm, we imagine a Cloud built on off the shelf, independent,
   network-connected resources and devices owned and managed by different
   users. Such users can both sell and/or buy their resources to/from Cloud
   providers or, alternatively, they can share them with other users
   establishing open interoperable Clouds.
   Being aware of the crucial and driving role played by the RESERVOIR,
   project in defining and implementing a reference architecture for Cloud
   computing, in this paper we focus on how to adapt and use the results of
   such project in the Cloud@Home specification. Starting from the
   RESERVOIR architecture, we discuss and detail how the Cloud@Home
   paradigm can be implemented on top of it, individuating components and
   modules to be integrated in a new reference architecture which allows to
   extend RESERVOIR, towards the Volunteer contributing paradigm, improving
   SLA management and federation issues and, at the same time, enhancing
   virtualization and resources management in Cloud@Home.}},

Abstract = {{Working groups have proposed building a layered set of protocols to
   solve Cloud Computing interoperability challenges. This is not the
   problem of application portability which calls for standardized
   programmer interfaces. This is the problem of generalized, transparent,
   back-end cloud-to-cloud federation. Current Intercloud designs do not
   envision each cloud provider establishing connectivity with another
   cloud provider in a Point-to-Point manner, as this will result into the
   n(2) complexity problem. Instead, Intercloud Directories, Exchanges, and
   Gateways will help facilitate as mediators for enabling connectivity and
   collaboration among disparate cloud providers in a manner analogous to
   the Internet itself. These Intercloud elements would implement a profile
   of protocols becoming known as Intercloud protocols. Researchers and
   working groups have proposed a layered set of such protocols using
   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol for transport, and Semantic
   Web with Resource Description Framework for resource matching. This
   paper builds on that work and discusses the next layer up, where a
   specific use case of federation is explored. We find that the back-end
   implementation of cloud-distributed, unstructured storage can be
   extended to generalized cloud-to-cloud federation using a Simple Storage
   Replication Protocol (SSRP), which is built on top of the base
   Intercloud protocol set. This paper details SSRP.}},

Abstract = {{Current Cloud Computing stack mainly targets-three architectural layers:
   Infrastructure, Platform and Software. These can be considered as
   services for the respective layers above. The infrastructure layer is
   provided as a service for the platform layer and the platform layer is,
   in turn, a service for the Software layer. Agent platforms fit the
   ``Platform as a service{''} layer within this stack. At the same time,
   innovative agent-oriented approaches to programming, open new
   possibilities for software design in the cloud. We introduce main
   characteristics of our pilot agent platform called UBIWARE and offer
   flexible servicing architecture within the cloud platform, where various
   components and systems can configure, run and reuse intelligent cloud
   services to provide higher degree of flexibility and interoperability
   for their applications.}},

Abstract = {{An expanding need for interoperability and structuralization of web data
   has made use of RDF (Resource Description Framework) plentiful. To
   guarantee a common usage of the data within various applications,
   several RDF stores providing data management services have been
   developed. Here, we represent a systematic approach to solve a late
   latency problem of data loading of the stores. It enables a fast loading
   performance for very large size of RDF data, and it is proven with an
   existing RDF store. This approach employs a cloud computing service and
   delegates preparation works to the machines which are temporarily
   borrowed at little payment. Our implementation for a native version of
   the Sesame RDF Repository was tested on LUBM 1000 University data (138
   million triples), and it showed a local store loading time of 16.2
   minutes with additional preparation time on a cloud service taking
   approximately an hour, which can be reduced by adding supplemental
   machines to the cluster.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a number of cloud platforms and services have been developed
   for data intensive computing, including Hadoop, Sector, Cloud Store
   (formerly KFS), HBase, and Thrift. In order to benchmark the performance
   of these systems, to investigate their interoperability, and to
   experiment with new services based on flexible compute node and network
   provisioning capabilities, we have designed and implemented a large
   scale testbed called the Open Cloud Testbed (OCT). Currently OCT has 120
   nodes in 4 data centers: Baltimore, Chicago (two locations), and San
   Diego. In contrast to other cloud testbeds, which are in small
   geographic areas and which are based on commodity Internet services, the
   OCT is a wide area testbed and the 4 data centers are connected with a
   high performance 10Gb/s network, based on a foundation of dedicated
   lightpaths. This testbed can address the requirements of extremely large
   data streams that challenge other types of distributed infrastructure.
   We have also developed several utilities to support the development of
   cloud computing systems and services, including novel node and network
   provisioning services, a monitoring system, and an RPC system. In this
   paper, we describe the OCT concepts, architecture, infrastructure, a few
   benchmarks that were developed for this platform, interoperability
   studies, and results.}},

Abstract = {{eGovernance has made rapid progress in the last decade. Today thousands
   of eGovernment systems are operational which provide a large variety of
   G2C, G2B and G2G services. With the rising maturity and complexity, the
   stakeholders have begun to realise the need for developing interoperable
   and reusable systems. The interoperability and reusability enables rapid
   scalability in terms of both functionality and reach. However, this is
   not possible if the eGovernment systems are designed and developed
   independently by different government agencies and departments, where
   the focus is only on achieving the agency / departmental objectives.
   With this realisation many Governments have adopted the Enterprise
   Architecture approach. The IEEE standard 1471 defines Enterprise
   Architecture as ``fundamental conception of a system in its environment
   embodied in its elements, their relationships to each other and to its
   environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution{''},
   and architecture framework as ``set of common practices for
   architectural description established within a specific domain or
   stakeholder community{''}. Various Governments and Government agencies
   have created architecture frameworks for use within their domain. Some
   examples are European Interoperability Framework (EIF), Federal
   Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) of USA etc. The Governments
   around the world are rapidly following these leads and building their
   own frameworks. The Government of India has constituted expert groups
   for building an interoperability framework as well as FEAF for
   eGovernance in India. While these developments are going on, a paradigm
   shift in the form of cloud computing appears to be taking shape. With
   the advent of cloud computing, and large scale support it is getting
   from the technology vendors, it is inevitable that before long,
   eGovernance architects will have to deal with cloud computing. A lot of
   literature has been generated with arguments for and against cloud
   computing. In this paper we first look at cloud computing from the
   architecture perspective. We have raised the issue of whether cloud
   should be viewed as just the infrastructure layer of an enterprise
   architecture ( based on the four layer EA model of TOGAF), or should it
   be viewed as the environment in which eGovernance systems operate, or
   both. We have then tried to categorise the issues about cloud computing
   based on how it is viewed architecturally. Then we look at some of these
   issues and challenges which will be more relevant to eGovernance
   architecture. We feel that once an architect has this clarity, he / she
   will be better equipped to make most optimal architectural decisions for
   the eGovernance system under construction.}},

   far, the Cloud computing approach is quickly and widely spreading in

   to implement an interoperable framework, allowing commercial and open

   Cloud@Home paradigm as an effective solution to the problem of building
   open and interoperable Clouds. In this new paradigm, users' hosts are
   not passive interface to Cloud services anymore, but they can interact
   (for free or by charge) with other Clouds, that therefore must be able

Abstract = {{The exciting developments in the World Wide Web (WWW) have revived
   interest in computer simulation for modeling, particularly for
   conceiving simulation languages and building model libraries that can be
   assembled and executed over the Internet, and for analysis, particularly
   for developing simulation optimization algorithms for parallel
   experimentation. This paper contributes to this second stream of
   research by introducing a framework for Optimization via Simulation
   (OvS) through Parallel Replicated Discrete Event Simulation (PRDES). In
   particular, we combine Nested Partitions (NP) and Extended Optimal
   Computing Budget Allocation (EOCBA) to provide an efficient framework
   for PRDES experiments. The number of candidate alternatives to be
   evaluated can be reduced by the application of NP. EOCBA, a modification
   of the Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) for PRDES, minimizes
   the number of simulation replications required to evaluate a particular
   alternative by allocating computing resources to potentially critical
   alternatives. We deploy web services technologies based on the Java Axis
   and. NET framework to create a viable infrastructure for heterogeneous
   PRDES systems. This approach, which receives increasing attention under
   the banners of `grid computing' and `cloud computing,' further promotes
   reusability, scalability, and interoperability. Experimental results
   with a prototype implementation not only furnish a proof of concept but
   also illustrate significant gains in simulation efficiency with PRDES.
   The proposed concept and techniques can also be applied to simulation

Abstract = {{The skyrocketing demand for a new generation of cloud-based consumer and
   business applications is driving the need for next generation of
   datacenters that must be massively scalable, efficient, agile, reliable
   and secure.
   The authors see a parallel between the state of the datacenters today
   and the evolution of the Intelligent Network (IN) infrastructure in
   telecommunication. The telecommunications networks have for many years,
   demonstrated their ability to reliably enable network (voice) services
   creation, assurance and delivery on a massive scale. Based on an
   analysis of the Intelligent Networks in telecommunications to identify
   proven concepts and key lessons that can be applied to enable next
   generation IT datacenters experience this paper asserts that:
   In order to scale cloud services reliably to millions of service
   developers and billions of end users the next generation cloud computing
   and datacenter infrastructure will have to follow an evolution similar
   to the one that led to the creation of scalable telecommunication
   networks.
   In the future network-based cloud service providers will leverage
   virtualization technologies to be able to allocate just the right levels
   of virtualized compute, network and storage resources to individual
   applications based on real-time business demand while also providing
   full service level assurance of availability, performance and security
   at a reasonable cost.
   A key component - identified in this paper as the Virtual Resource
   Mediation Layer (VRML), must be developed through industry collaboration
   to enable interoperability of various public and private clouds. This
   layer will form the basis for ensuring massive scalability of cloud
   infrastructure by enabling distributed service creation, service
   delivery and service assurance without any single vendor domination.
   The next generation virtualization technologies must allow applications
   to dynamically access CPU, memory, bandwidth and storage (capacity, I/O
   and throughput) in a manner similar to that of the telecommunications
   800 Service Call Model with one level of indirection and mediation.
   The authors believe that the next generation cloud evolution is a
   fundamental transformation and not just an evolutionary stack of XaaS
   implementations, which will enable global service collaboration networks
   utilizing optimally distributed and managed computing, network and
   storage resources driven in real - time by business priorities.}},

Abstract = {{Current cloud computing infrastructure offerings are lacking in
   interoperability, which is a hindrance to the advancement and adoption
   of the cloud computing paradigm. As clouds are made interoperable,
   federations of clouds may be formed. Such federations are from the point
   of view of the user not burdened by vendor lock-in, and opens for
   business possibilities where a market place of cloud computing
   infrastructure can be formed. Federated clouds require unified
   management interfaces regarding the virtual machines (VMs) that comprise
   the services running in the cloud federation. Standardization efforts
   for the required management interfaces have so far focused on definition
   of description formats regarding VMs, and the control of already
   deployed VMs. We propose technology-neutral interfaces and architectural
   additions for handling placement, migration, and monitoring of VMs in
   federated cloud environments, the latter as an extension of current
   monitoring architectures used in Grid computing. The interfaces
   presented adhere to the general requirements of scalability, efficiency,
   and security in addition to specific requirements related to the
   particular issues of interoperability and business relationships between
   competing cloud computing infrastructure providers. In addition, they
   may be used equally well locally and remotely, creating a layer of
   abstraction that simplifies management of virtualized service
   components.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing is a term applied to large, hosted datacenters, usually
   geographically, distributed, which offer various computational services
   on a ``utility{''} basis. Most typically the configuration and
   provisioning of these datacenters, as far as the services for the
   subscribers go, is highly automated, to the point of the service being
   delivered within seconds of the subscriber request. Additionally, the
   datacenters typically use hypervisor based virtualization as a technique
   to deliver these services. The concept of a cloud operated by one
   service provider or enterprise interoperating with a clouds operated by
   another is a powerful idea. So Jar that is limited to use cases vi,here
   code running on One cloud explicitly references a service on another
   cloud There is no implicit and transparent interoperability. Use cases
   for interoperability, as well as work in-progress around inter-cloud
   protocols and formats for enabling those use cases, are discussed in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel combinatorial auction (CA) based Cloud
   market model that facilitates dynamic collaboration (DC) among Cloud
   providers (CPs) for providing composite/collaborative Cloud services to
   consumers and hence can address the interoperability and scalability
   issues for Cloud computing. Also to minimize the conflicts that may
   happen when negotiating among providers in a DC platform, we propose a
   new auction policy in CA that allows a CP to dynamically collaborate
   with suitable partner CPs to form a group before joining the auction and
   to publish their group bids as a single bid to fulfill the service
   requirements completely. But to find a good combination of CP partners
   is a NP-hard problem. So we propose a promising multi-objective (MO)
   optimization model for CP partner selection that not only uses their
   individual information (IN!) but also their past collaborative
   relationship information (PR!) which is seldom considered in existing
   approaches. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) called MOGA-IC is
   also developed to solve the model. We implemented our proposed CACM
   model and the MOGA-IC in a simulated environment and study their
   economic efficiency and performance with existing model and algorithm.
   The experimental results show that the proposed MOGA-IC can support
   satisfactory and high quality partner selection in CA CM model.}},

Abstract = {{Trust is one of the most important means to improve security and enable
   interoperability of current heterogeneous independent cloud platforms.
   This paper first analyzed several trust models used in large and
   distributed environment and then introduced a novel cloud trust model to
   solve security issues in cross-clouds environment in which cloud
   customer can choose different providers' services and resources in
   heterogeneous domains can cooperate. The model is domain-based. It
   divides one cloud provider's resource nodes into the same domain and
   sets trust agent. It distinguishes two different roles cloud customer
   and cloud server and designs different strategies for them. In our
   model, trust recommendation is treated as one type of cloud services
   just like computation or storage. The model achieves both identity
   authentication and behavior authentication. The results of emulation
   experiments show that the proposed model can efficiently and safely
   construct trust relationship in cross-clouds environment.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, Grid computing has become an increasingly hot
   topic in the world of new technologies. It is gradually also becoming
   familiar to the mass public through scientific and industrial field
   trials. Grid computing has been adopted and is used by academia and
   industry due to its high potential for improving manageability,
   utilizations, and performance of geographically distributed and diverse
   resource centers. During 2008 and 2009 commercial interest shifted from
   ``grids{''} to ``clouds{''}, with the availability of several on-demand
   compute and storage resources. Recently, interest has been growing to
   integrate grid and cloud computing with the Next Generation Network
   (NGN) in the telecommunication domain. Telecom operators are bound to
   become key players in a grid and cloud computing value chain as they
   provide connectivity and own computing resources. Moreover they have
   established customer relationships and accounting/billing experience,
   essential for business/commercial grids and clouds. Defining the best
   ways to integrate existing as well as future telecommunication equipment
   and network infrastructure with grids and clouds assumes the
   availability of interoperable Grid solutions built by IT in conjunction
   with the Telecom industry. This paper describes the approach taken by
   ETSI Technical Committee for Grid computing (TC GRID) and STF 331 (ICT
   GRID Technologies Interoperability and Standardization) to support the
   integration of grid and cloud computing with the NGN architecture.}},
